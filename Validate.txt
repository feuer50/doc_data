Title:	Butane hydrocracking pilot trials at Southwest Research Institute
Project:	Butane to Ethane
Authors:	Robert Broekhuis

executive summary
A three-reactor hydrotreating apparatus at Southwest Research Institute was reconfigured to conduct a pilot trial of SABIC’s bifunctional hydrocracking catalyst to convert a mixed butanes feed to a mixture of predominantly lighter hydrocarbons, rich in ethane. The reactors were operated in a simulated adiabatic mode, with electric heaters compensating for heat losses, to allow the temperature profiles through the reactors to approximate those expected in a commercial adiabatic reactor. Feed temperatures to each of the reactors were controlled individually to achieve suitable overall conversion and selectivity.
Reconfiguration and commissioning of the reactor system took more time than anticipated, leaving less time for continuous operation than originally envisioned, but steady and reliable operation was eventually attained. Four runs, totaling 77 days on stream, were conducted using the final catalyst loading of an improved catalyst formulation with low Si/Al ratio. The final run, lasting 45 days, was carried out at relatively constant operating conditions (space velocity 2.3 h-1, hydrogen/butane molar ratio=1, 100 psig, reactor inlet temperatures selected to produce ~520°C outlet temperatures), with especially steady operation during the final weeks. An overall ethane carbon yield about 52% was maintained. No progressive catalyst deactivation was observed during this interval, although coke accumulations of 3-16 wt% were observed in post-run catalyst analysis.
Thermodynamic analysis of operating data reveals that the simulated adiabatic operating mode was moderately successful for the first two reactors, while the third reactor experienced a much higher temperature rise than would be expected at adiabatic operation. This is attributed to problems measuring heater/wall temperatures in this reactor, and had to be corrected for in subsequent reactor modeling. 
The measured conversions, especially in the first reactor, were found to be much higher than values predicted using a previously developed reactor model, mostly due to higher activity at low temperature. This is partly attributed to the newer, more active catalyst used in the pilot runs, but also indicates that more low-temperature data would need to be acquired to adjust the hydrocracking kinetic model for better predictive power across the entire temperature range.


Background
Processes to convert a mixed butane feed to a product mix rich in ethane are being developed in CRD, as a possible means of alleviating ethane feedstock shortages in Saudi Arabia. The R&D program, conducted by a team in the Feedstocks & Energy Department at STCH, initially built on earlier development of a bifunctional catalyst developed to conduct mild hydrocracking of heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks. Laboratory performance trials confirmed that variations of this catalyst were capable of fully converting a stream comprising both n-butane and isobutane, producing a product with ethane as its primary component, with propane and methane as secondary products. The catalyst is platinum on a ZSM-5 zeolite; the specific composition was optimized in early laboratory trials, during which nominal operating conditions were also established (space velocities ranging from 2-4 kg/kgcath, hydrogen-to-butane ratio around 1, temperatures from 430-480°C, pressure around 100 psig). These early studies were followed up with catalyst life testing in larger bench-scale reactors, which confirmed adequate catalyst life and established methods for periodic catalyst regeneration.
The desired chemistry is moderately exothermic, resulting in an adiabatic temperature rise for full conversion in the vicinity of 200°C for typical operating conditions. The lab and bench scale reactors were not operated adiabatically: the lab reactors were nearly isothermal, while the bench scale reactors exhibited a limited axial temperature gradient near the front end of the catalyst bed. The commercial process concept to manage heat of reaction is a sequence of adiabatic reactors with interstage cooling; to demonstrate this concept, pilot-scale testing at near-adiabatic conditions is required.
A second catalyst system, promoting hydrogenolysis at a lower temperature range, was developed while experimentation with the hydrocracking catalyst was ongoing. This catalyst was found to produce a product slate with a higher selectivity towards ethane, but converted primarily n-butane, leaving most isobutane in the product stream. When suitable process schemes had been defined to accomplish the full conversion of a mixed butanes stream with the hydrogenolysis catalyst, this system was found to have the most favorable process economics, and therefore became the front-runner for further development. However, because certain aspects of both catalyst systems, such as catalyst life and regenerability, remained items of technical risk, it was decided to proceed with piloting both catalyst systems and associated process concepts in parallel. Two piloting locations were identified: an existing pilot reactor system previously used for naphtha hydrocracking at STCG, and a hydrotreating reactor system available at Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, TX). The former, having been extensively developed and demonstrated for the previous project, was selected to pilot the frontrunner hydrogenolysis catalyst; pilot testing is ongoing, and will be documented in a separate report. The latter was used to pilot the bifunctional hydrocracking catalyst; this is the subject of the current report.
The objectives of the pilot trials were 1) to demonstrate the performance of the hydrocracking catalyst system when operated under adiabatic conditions at the operating conditions established during laboratory testing, 2) to identify any sources of technical risk and if possible identify mitigating approaches, and 3) to confirm stability of the catalyst system over durations of 1-3 months, consistent with bench-scale studies. Additional objectives that were tentatively defined included longer operation for extended life testing along with implementation of in-situ regeneration strategies. However, by the time the initial objectives had been addressed, piloting of the hydrogenolysis catalyst system had proven largely successful; since technical risks of the front-runner concept appeared to be quite manageable, it was decided to not pursue the follow-on studies for the hydrocracking catalyst.
Project timeline
The piloting plan was based on a proposal from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). Equipment modifications and commissioning were slated to commence in late summer of 2018, followed by three months of continuous operation to extend into early 2019. Due to the timing of other-customer projects at SwRI, the initial phase was somewhat delayed, and required rather more elapsed time when it became clear that the equipment and controls modifications required to establish reliable continuous operation were most extensive than anticipated. Even after initial reliability problems had been resolved, the reactor system required several additional overhauls after testing commenced in late 2018. Multiple short runs (2-3 days) were conducted in December 2018 and January 2019 to establish the start-up procedures and align instrumentation and analytical. Following these commissioning efforts, several longer runs were conducted, still interrupted by shutdowns and equipment upgrades as progress was made towards higher reliability. As a result, continuous operation time was divided among several shorter runs, listed in the following table (catalyst load designations are explained in the corresponding section below):

The final run was completed after modifications to significantly improve reliability of the preheaters, and was by far the longest, with significant time of operation at steady conditions. Most of this report will focus on this final run.

The reactors are arranged in series, with downflow through each reactor. Because of the high flowrates and specific project requirements, much of the interconnecting tubing and auxiliary equipment was reconfigured or built afresh relative to previous projects. A mixed butanes feed (70% n-butane, 30% isobutane) was provided as a custom mixture in a tank truck (Matheson Trigas, 99.5+%), with driving pressure from a nitrogen pad maintained in the tank headspace; the liquid butane stream was dosed using a liquid volumetric flow controller, with secondary mass flow measurement by a Coriolis flowmeter, and vaporized/preheated through a sequence of electrically heated preheating pipes. Hydrogen was delivered from a tube trailer, through gas mass flow controllers, and also electrically preheated. Hydrogen and butane streams were mixed in a simple tee upstream of the first reactor. The system was designed to allow operation at a space velocity of 4 kgbutane/kgcath, although lower throughputs were maintained in the actual runs.
The inlet temperatures to each of the reactors were maintained by electrical heat tracing applied to the inlet tubing. Although gas coolers were originally installed as interstage coolers between R301 and R101 and between R101 and R201, these were removed early on since ambient heat loss was high enough to provide the required cooling. A gas cooler was maintained downstream of R201 and upstream of the main pressure control valve; downstream of this valve, the effluent was cooled in a knockout pot equipped with a cooling coil. The effluent flow was measured using a Coriolis flowmeter before being sent to a flare. 
Two GCs were configured to analyze a total of four sample streams: the mixed inlet stream, and the effluents from each of the reactors. The instruments were identically configured with three injector-column-detector trains (1 FID, 2 TCDs) to allow analysis of inorganic gases (H2, N2, O2, CO, CO2) and organics from methane through C10 hydrocarbons. In most of the runs, the first GC was dedicated to the inlet stream, while the second GC alternated between the three effluent streams.
The overall system was controlled using an OPTO PLC system interfaced with an iFix front end. The unit was approved for unattended operation, and was generally monitored during working hours on weekdays.
Appendix A contains the P&IDs for the system as finally configured for Run 5. Several subsystems of specific importance are further discussed in sections below.
Butane delivery train
As mentioned, the mixed butanes stream was delivered from a nitrogen-padded large tanker. The pad pressure was maintained using nitrogen from a nearby cryogenic tank with vaporizer. It fluctuated somewhat with day/night cycles as well as usage patterns from other users of the nitrogen supply, but was generally between 130 and 160 psig, sufficient to provide butane to the reactor system operated at a downstream pressure of 100 psig.
The use of nitrogen resulted in a non-neglible amount of dissolved nitrogen traveling with the butane feed to the reactors; it was consistently measured by the GCs in both inlet and outlet compositions, at levels between 0.5 and 1 vol% in the mixed hydrogen/butanes stream, which is qualitatively consistent with the solubility of nitrogen in butanes. The butane tank was refilled in April, just before the start of run 5; this resulted in an initially low nitrogen content in the feed, increasing over 10 days as headspace nitrogen slowly dissolved into the butane towards an equilibrium value (see Figure 12 below).
As ambient temperatures increased in the spring, instabilities started arising in the butane flow delivery, evident from both the liquid flow controller performance (characterized by wild fluctuations) and the density readout from the secondary Coriolis flowmeter (which dropped below the liquid density of butane). The malperformance was attributed to the formation of bubbles in the liquid butane feed, predominantly consisting of nitrogen (at the feed pressure, the bubble point of the mixed butanes stream itself was well above any ambient temperature). Stored butane, remaining at relatively constant temperature in the large storage tank, would increase in temperature as it traveled through several tens of feet of tubing towards the reactor system, and also undergo a slight decrease in pressure; both are conducive to the formation of a small amount of vapor phase. Once this problem was recognized, it was remediated by including a small heat exchanger with chilled water as coolant just upstream of the flowmeter/flow controller. These modifications resulted in generally stable feed performance.
In the original system configuration, butane vaporization and preheating was accomplished in a sequence of three vertical upflow preheaters, each consisting of an empty 1-inch pipe wrapped with high-temperature electrical heat tracing. While this system had shown adequate heat transfer characteristics in nitrogen flow testing, it proved inadequate for reliably delivering a heated butane vapor stream. Temperatures measured in the first heater, where most of the vaporization took place, fluctuated with wild swings, suggesting periodic operation, e.g. surging or slugging dynamics. More importantly, measured mixed feed compositions showed a great deal of variability in the hydrogen-to-butanes ratio, which was also indicative of non-steady flow conditions.
Two measures were taken to improve performance: first, the heaters were filled with packing material constructed of stainless steel mesh, to improve heat transfer and improve hydrodynamics. Following this change, the temperature fluctuations were no longer observed, but the feed compositions continued to show a good deal of variability. Next, the hydrogen feed system was reconfigured to introduce a portion of the hydrogen into the butanes stream upstream of the vaporizer/preheater, using a second mass flow controller. This hydrogen promotes earlier vaporization of the butanes (avoiding cyclic superheating) and acts as a carrier to suppress non-steady hydrodynamics. After some optimization, it was found that with about 20% of the total hydrogen stream introduced upstream, the variability of feed composition was greatly reduced.
While this system performed competently after these modifications, the coiled heat tracing cables providing the heat in the vaporizer/preheater were found to be prone to failure even though they were rated for operation at higher temperature. When these failures had resulted in premature shutdown of several runs, it was decided to overhaul the system, replacing the heat tracing with a series of conventional ceramic clamshell heaters before startup of run 5. This modification was successful, allowing the final run to complete without further interruptions.

[bookmark: _Ref13825056]Figure 1. Trends of temperatures and heater outputs in the first butane vaporizer/preheater during a representative four-day span of run 5.
As an illustrative example, Figure 1 plots the temperatures and heater outputs in the first vaporizer and preheater during a four-day span of run 5. The temperatures are well in control (internal process temperature TE906 is of most importance in this regard), and continue to be through the second and third preheaters, not shown here. Throughout this time span, the heater power varies to maintain these steady temperature levels. Note the periodic pattern of the TE602 temperature (in the heat-traced zone just upstream of the preheater). The fluctuations appear with a period of about 16 hours, which was consistent throughout the run; the same cyclic pattern was observed in a few other temperatures, physically quite removed from TE602. The source of these patterns was never elucidated, but given the lack of correlation with day/night cycle or ambient temperatures, it appears likely related to an artifact of the control system or the electrical supply. The fluctuations do not appear to propagate into the realm of reactor performance, so they were not considered to be a major concern.
Reactors
The reactor system was originally built as a hydrotreating system with a preheater and two reactors. Through subsequent projects, the preheater came to be used as a third reactor, resulting in the configuration used in the current project, with three reactors having somewhat different dimensions. All three are configured for high pressure (>1000 psig), with Grayloc closure systems at upstream and downstream ends. The stainless steel reactor tubes are enclosed in clamshell heater arrangements, with somewhat different equipment configuration for each of the reactors (six ceramic heaters for the first, five ceramic heaters for the second, and five metallic heaters for the third), resulting in different heat transfer dynamics. Catalyst and catalyst support particles are supported on metallic grates that are installed as part of the bottom closure, with a multipoint thermocouple extending upward through the length of the reactor, with internal temperature measurement points corresponding to the centers of the heating zones. External temperatures were measured at the same axial positions using spring-loaded thermocouples extending through the heaters to the reactor surface. The reactors featured insulation typical of such heater systems, sufficient for personnel protection and avoidance of gross heat loss, but not nearly as effective as the insulation installed for the purpose-built pilot plant at STCG. Compared to the STCG system, the number of individually controllable zones per reactor was also much smaller. Therefore, heat losses were greater (especially at the upper and lower ends of the reactors), with less well-defined temperature distributions and not nearly as tight a temperature control as is possible at STCG.
Conceptually, however, the control philosophy for the reactors was similar: adiabatic operation was approximated by using the electric heaters to just compensate for heat loss, in this case by controlling the difference between the internal and external thermocouples at each axial location to a zero setpoint. The control loops operated fairly successfully, although not with the same high fidelity as accomplished at STCG. For example, the difference between internal and external thermocouples fluctuated in a -3 to +3°C band for most of the thermocouples in the first reactor (with somewhat higher fluctuations seen in the bottom-most heating zone). The best control of this delta is seen in the topmost zone, which suggests that the fluctuations seen further downstream are likely due more to variability of flow (i.e., space velocity, which governs conversion and adiabatic temperature rise) than to poor performance of the temperature control loops themselves. 
An illustrative example of reactor temperature control is shown in Figure 2, plotting temperatures and outputs over a one-day interval. While the inlet temperature is controlled quite well, larger variations are evident at downstream thermocouples. These might be attributed to gradual variations in (total) flow or composition (hydrogen:butanes ratio) across the day; the external temperatures follow the internal trends reasonably well, but of course deviations become greater as the rate of internal temperature swing increases. Note also that the output of the bottom-most heater (TIC307) is much higher than that of any of the upstream heaters, indicative of the much higher heat loss near the bottom of the reactor, requiring a higher compensating heater duty.
Although the reactor systems were old and some of the heaters displayed some age-related reliability problems, they performed adequately once appropriate repairs had been made, with all heaters in operation throughout the final run.

Catalyst loading
Since the three reactors have different dimensions, the amounts of catalyst loaded in each are also different; for each, the aim was to fill the majority of the heated zone of the reactors with catalyst, leaving some length of inert support/heat transfer material both above and below the catalyst to avoid having catalyst in the parts of the reactor most affected by the greater extent of heat loss near the top and bottom ends. Practically, this means that about 20% of the catalyst is present in the first reactor, 35% in the second, and 45% in the third. Reported space velocities are always based on the total amount of catalyst in all three reactors; individual reactor space velocities are of course higher.
After the initial round of commissioning, subsequent catalyst loads used Denstone 1/8” spheres (Norpro St. Gobain) as the inert material. The reactors were fully loaded three times: once for commissioning in November 2018 (A), once for initial runs in December 2018 (B), and finally for the longer runs in February 2019 (C). After a process upset led to high temperatures in the third reactor, the catalyst in that reactor was changed out in late March 2019 (D).

[bookmark: _Ref13833881]Figure 3. Long extrudates from catalyst batch ZD18029
Catalyst loads A and B used catalyst from an initial shipment of two drums of extrudates produced by Zeolyst (ZD15015A). This was at that time the standard catalyst formulation, with 0.3% Pt on ZSM-5 with a silica-alumina ratio (SAR) ratio of 50. Loads C and D used catalyst from a smaller batch of newly prepared catalyst with a lower SAR of 30 (ZD18029). Characteristics of both catalysts are presented in the table below.

The first catalyst was produced in a large quantity, with equipment that allowed size control of the extrudate lengths; the second catalyst was produced in smaller-scale equipment, with less control over the extrudate lengths. The resulting extrudates were longer (see Figure 3), which resulted in a lower packing density than for the first batch. The density of the first batch was measured using lab cylinders selected to have similar size as the SwRI reactors; this is the 655 kg/m3 in the table above. The density was not measured for the second batch, but results from catalyst loading suggest the effective packing density was about 20% lower. This resulted in lower catalyst amounts being loaded (to obtain same geometric configuration of catalyst beds) than was anticipated, and hence requiring a lower feed flowrate to achieve the same weight hourly space velocity.
Weights of inert materials and catalysts loaded were recorded on catalyst load data sheets, along with the depth (measured from face of top flange) after each stage of loading.

Startup and operation
The purpose of the early runs was primarily to gain experience in startup and line-out of the reactor system. Early startup attempts were slow and methodical, but due to lack of experience they still sometimes resulted in undesired operating modes. Through the development of a well-defined startup protocol, it became possible to start up and line out the reactors in a controlled way, within a time span of two days. This protocol is described below.
After loading the reactors and verifying the absence of leaks, hydrogen flow was established through both mass flow controllers (through the hydrogen heater and the butane heater) to the reactors, while nitrogen was introduced through the butane feed train, at the desired setpoint pressure (typically 100 psig). The hydrogen heater, butane heaters, and line heat tracing circuits were then brought up to manual values sufficient to establish a suitable initial temperature profile. Once the preheater temperatures reached a high enough value to support butane vaporization, butane flow was quickly ramped to its setpoint value and nitrogen flow stopped. Preheater controls were then set to automatic to establish a temperature profile along the various heaters that had previously been shown to result in smooth heatup and even distribution of heating load among the heaters. This initial phase of startup could be completed in about 5 hours. At its conclusion, the temperature and composition at the inlet of the first reactor were close to their desired values.
Up to this point, the reactor heaters remained off, allowing the process gas to lose heat as it flowed through the reactor. Depending on feed conditions, a mild temperature increase would typically be observed through the first reactor, resulting from limited conversion. The next phase was the lining out of the reactor heaters. This was typically done in a top-down fashion, starting with the top zone of the first reactor. Initial values of heater outputs could be conservatively entered (by stepwise increases in manual mode) based on experience from prior runs. When the external and internal temperatures of a zone were in reasonable proximity, the control loop could be turned to auto in “delta mode”, aiming for the external temperature to match the internal one. Since adding heat to the reactor system raises the internal temperature and promotes additional reaction and heat generation, the heater adjustments create what is likened to a “waterfall effect”, hence the need to proceed from top of the reactor downward. To some extent, the three reactors can be lined out in parallel, but since the line heaters in between reactors do not provide sufficient power to overcome all heat losses, meaningful line-out could only start when the preceding reactor had established a temperature rise large enough to bring the next reactor to the desired feed temperature. This phase of startup required careful attention and was done more slowly to avoid temperatures spiking higher than desired. Working only during daytime hours, full lineout could be established in about two days; further optimization based on operating experience would be possible.
At several times during early operation, temperature spikes to as high as 600°C were observed when the combination of inlet temperature and feed flow/composition to a reactor would promote high conversion. Such temperatures were still within the limits of safe operation of the reactors, so generally did not cause a full shutdown. Compared to experience reported from the STCG hydrogenolysis system piloting, runaway in the hydrocracking system appears to be more muted, with less tendency to spike high and less sensitivity to feed temperature changes. This was fortunate, because the temperature control in the SwRI preheater/reactor system was not nearly as tight as could be accomplished at STCG, temperatures fluctuating by +/- 1°C even during periods of good control, and more during upsets in flow control or other system components. The greater robustness against runaway can be attributed to a few factors:
· Compared to hydrogenolysis, the hydrocracking reactors are operated at higher temperature, where the sensitivity of reactor rate to incremental temperature increases is smaller per the Arrhenius equation. This is also expressed in the Zeldovich number, which contains the square of the absolute temperature in the denominator; a high value of the Zeldovich number renders a process conducive to runaway.
· Inherent energy buffering in the reaction network: as temperatures increase, endothermic dehydrogenation reactions become more favorable, including those that produce aromatics. Through the contribution of these reactions, the overall temperature rise is suppressed.
· Higher heat loss in the reactor system: compared to the highly insulated STCG reactors, the SwRI reactors lose more heat at their respective process temperatures. While this heat loss is compensated for at steady state, during a sudden temperature increase the compensating heaters do not respond as quickly (and may be limited by their maximum output values), causing a net energy outflow and thereby suppressing the temperature rise below the adiabatic value.
The first two factors, which are inherent to the reaction system, are probably more important than the third, but a detailed analysis has not been conducted.
Once the system dynamics were appreciated, temperature excursions became much rarer. In the final, longest run, flow disruptions caused a few momentary spikes, with reactor exit temperatures briefly increasing by up to 40°C above their steady-state values, but overall the desired temperature profiles through the reactors were reliably maintained.
Although inlet temperatures to the reactors were well controlled, the outlet temperatures underwent much greater fluctuations, as reported above; the example in Figure 2 displays a range of 492-510°C for the outlet temperature of the first reactor over the course of one day. These fluctuations are likely due to variability in feed flow and composition; regardless of their origin, their unknown dynamics make it quite challenging to attempt to control the outlet temperatures (as a proxy for conversion) of the reactors. Hence, this was not attempted, opting instead for steady reactor inlet temperatures and allowing the outlet temperatures to ride their cycle.
Given this simple approach to overall system control, not much interaction with the reactor system was required during day-to-day steady operation, besides ensuring the availability of feeds and the reliability of supporting functions such as chillers, flare system, analytical, and heat tracing. During the final run, the unit was partially attended during working hours, and unattended during overnight hours and weekends Alarms were delivered by cell phone, and sometimes prompted operators to take action remotely.
Data from the various instruments was compiled daily into an Excel spreadsheet and sent for inspection, along with the results from GC analysis. Processing of these daily files was automated using Excel macros, allowing for quick inspection of incremental results every business day.
GC analytical – online and condensate samples
As noted before, two gas chromatographs were set up in service of this piloting effort. Both were older Varian instruments, configured as refinery gas analyzers to allow quantitation of a wide range of inorganic and organic compounds. Among the inorganics, only hydrogen and nitrogen were of practical importance; among organics, the primary components observed were methane, ethane, propane, isobutane and n-butane. Propylene and the butene isomers were also observed and individually quantified, as were pentane (isomer speciation suspect), benzene, toluene, and the xylenes. Other peaks were lumped into groups by estimated carbon count, although usually no compounds greater than C6 (besides toluene and xylenes) were seen in measurable quantities.
The GC instruments were configured, calibrated, and maintained by an analytical team, separate from the core process operators. After initial calibration, calibration consistency was checked by periodically injecting several calibration gases onto both GCs (continuous calibration verification, CCV). While these were helpful at times to identify problems, they were not done frequently enough to allow recalibration or re-interpretation of flawed results; when questionable GC results were obtained, the analytical team was called on to adjust the method or manually re-integrate chromatograms. Perhaps because of the age of the equipment, its setup in a non-air-conditioned space, or inconsistency of sample flow, the quality and consistency of the GC data was somewhat less than would be expected from typical modern instruments. However, it was sufficient to determine selectivities and discern trends, and in any case, variability in the GC sample results is probably due more to actual fluctuations in process parameters than to imperfect GC analysis.
It was originally envisioned that the two GCs would each cycle through the four sample points (feed, and effluents from the three reactors), to eliminate any instrument bias on trend results. However, because of complications with sample delivery and selection it was decided early on to use each of the GCs for dedicated samples. Since obtaining a steady feed composition proved to be more challenging than anticipated, the first GC was dedicated solely to feed shots, which can be completed using a shorter cycle time due to the absence of heavy components. The second GC alternated between the reactor effluents, in a pattern favoring the final effluent from the third reactor, since this is indicative of overall process performance.
Two measures serve as primary quality checks on the GC analytical data: the total of compounds analyzed by GC (for all samples), and the fraction of isobutane among the butanes (in the feed sample): these should not be affected by any process fluctuations, and can be analyzed in isolation. The iso fraction could drift somewhat with time, as the lighter component distributes to a greater extent to the tanker headspace, but this should be a minor effect given the low inventory in the headspace.
The progression of these two metrics during run 5 is shown in Figure 4. The iso fraction trend is interrupted (adjusted upward) at two points, as a result of GC recalibration, but follows an overall downward progression as if decaying towards a fixed value. This systematic trend, if it is indicative of shifting GC performance, is troubling, because it may mean that there is a systematic error in the GC analysis that is changing in magnitude with time.

[bookmark: _Ref13834010]Figure 4. Trends of the measured isobutane fraction among total butanes (expected value: 0.3) and the total of quantified GC components (expected value: 100%) during run 5. 
The GC total trend displays a distinct day/night cycle; during the second half of the run, its average value is fairly close to 100%. The cycle may be due to variation of the flow delivered by the liquid butane flow controller as density cycles with ambient temperature, combined with imperfect calibration of the GC. Or it may be related to variations in sample flow or pressure with ambient conditions. The fluctuations are not a cause of great concern, since their effects will average out over the course of a day, allowing longer-term trends to emerge. Specific results from process sample analysis and their interpretation will be presented later in this report.
The knockout pot downstream of the third reactor was designed to separate any liquids from the cooled effluent gas before sending the latter to flare. In practice, very little liquid accumulation was observed during normal operation – during run 5, an insufficient amount for analysis. Earlier in piloting, perhaps because of colder ambient temperatures, a little more condensate could be collected, from the reactor system knockout pot as well as a knockout pot in the line running to the flare. These liquids were analyzed by an offline GC in SwRI’s analytical department; results are shown below in terms of area% (which should correspond roughly to wt%).

The difference in composition between these samples is likely due to the colder condition at the (outside) flare knockout, causing some components that had not been condensed in the earlier knockout pot to drop out; they may have combined with some liquid that had condensed earlier at warmer conditions, resulting in a wider distribution of light and heavy compounds, compared to the heavy-weighted composition of the reactor system knockout. In any case, the component slate is qualitatively consistent with previous results reported by Heng Shou for a bench-scale hydrocracking reactor[footnoteRef:1]. Given the very small rate of accumulation, the formation of these heavy compounds does not affect the system mass balance, although even small concentrations may be relevant to downstream operations, e.g. because of fouling/ gumming potential.

Run 5 results
The final run 5 had by far the longest onstream time in the overall piloting campaign, and also the longest stretch of operation uninterrupted by shutdowns or upsets. Therefore, this run will be subjected to the greatest scrutiny in this report. Full results from all longer runs are available on the project share drive (Y:\C4-C5 Utilization Program\SwRI) for further analysis if necessary.
Run conditions
The reactors were started up according to the protocol described above. The initial space velocity was about 3 kgbutane/kgcath, adjusted downward to 2.8 after several days of operation. Following startup, the operating conditions of the reactors were adjusted to obtain a suitably high ethane yield, as was required to compete with the higher-selectivity hydrogenolysis process. There is no a priori method to distribute conversion across the three reactors – unlike in the hydrogenolysis piloting effort, where conversion per reactor was limited by runaway concerns, the conversions across each of the reactors could be freely adjusted here, by manipulating the feed temperature to each of the reactors. The term “conversion” must be used somewhat loosely here, because the butanes in the feed are converted relatively readily to smaller molecules, leaving the more difficult conversion of propane for the downstream reactors. Without referring to exact measures of chemical conversion, the reactive duty of each of the reactors may be characterized by the temperature rise across the reactor. In multi-reactor predictive modeling performed using the hydrocracking kinetics developed in an earlier effort, a progression along the three reactors with increasing inlet and outlet temperatures had been proposed for the pilot reactors. However, this approach was adjusted somewhat in light of observations made early in the run. When temperatures were pushed high enough to obtain the desired yield of ethane, the methane yield was higher than expected. Since methane make is a strong function of temperature, it was decided to run each of the reactors with the same outlet temperature, to avoid a particularly high temperature in any one of the reactors. At the space velocity applied, the outlet temperature producing a sufficient yield of ethane was around 520°C. Therefore, inlet temperatures were established to produce roughly this outlet temperature in each of the reactors: 395°C in the first reactor, 418°C in the second reactor, and 440°C in the third reactor. This means that the first reactor, despite having far less catalyst and hence a higher space velocity than the others, achieves the highest amount of reaction, and the last, largest reactor, the smallest amount. This is not entirely surprising: the easy hydrocracking of butanes is mostly completed in the first reactor, while more difficult conversion of propane takes place partly in the second reactor and mostly in the third.
The space velocity established early on in the run was 2.8 kg butane/kgcath. In light of the high methane make, it was reduced to 2.5 kg butane/kgcath about 10 days into the run, in the hope that it would be possible to lower the reactor temperatures to achieve the same ethane yield. Even though temperatures could indeed be reduced somewhat, the methane make did not meaningfully change. On May 16, the reactor system shut down due to an instrument failure, and was restarted the following day, at a further lowered space velocity of 2.3 kg butane/kgcath. In the interest of maintaining steady reaction conditions for the maximum onstream time, it was decided to retain these, admittedly not optimized, reaction conditions for the remainder of the run.
The same pressure, 100 psig at the outlet of the final reactor, was maintained throughout the run.
Feed composition
The aim throughout the piloting campaign, including in run 5, was to operate with an equimolar mixture of butanes and hydrogen. However, due to the characteristics of the flow controllers, this composition was not exactly maintained throughout the run.
The butanes stream was delivered by an Alicat liquid flow controller, operating on a principle of pressure drop measurement through a laminar flow stack. Two controllers were used in the project; both had been factory-calibrated for the butanes mixture, but obtaining accurate and reliable performance proved to be elusive. Controllers were swapped out on several occasions, including once during an outage in run 5 in an attempt to resolve noisy control performance. However, variability remained greater than expected based on product specifications. The variability was not just signal/measurement variability from the controller’s sensing element: the redundant Coriolis mass flow meter just upstream of the flow controller had a similarly noisy signal, suggesting that the flow variations were real. 
The variability of flow had an important impact on controller operation. Since the butanes were dosed by liquid volumetric flow, the readout must be multiplied by density to obtain mass flow; the system being operated in a non-air-conditioned space, temperature and density fluctuations were not negligible, so the measured temperature of the butane feed was used in daily data processing to calculate the mass flow. This meant that the butanes mass flow varied on a day/night cycle. Had flow been relatively steady, the setpoint of the controller could have been adjusted based on the reading of the Coriolis meter, but the signal was too noisy to implement this. The alternative of using butane temperature to adjust the liquid flow setpoint was considered but could not be implemented in a timely fashion. Therefore, a slight variability (+/- 1.5%) of butanes mass flow, in a daily cycle pattern, is a consistent feature of the run.

The two hydrogen mass flow controllers were also somewhat noisy, but their performance appeared to be steady. In combination, the butane and hydrogen flow controls should therefore have resulted in a feed composition with slight variation around the 50% mark. Figure 5 shows the actual progression of GC analytical for the feed composition. In the first half of the run, mass flow controller issues resulted in considerable deviation from the 50% hydrogen level. After swapping out the flow controller around May 17, better conformance to the desired level was observed. From that point, the setpoints of the three mass flow controllers were maintained at identical values; the slight upward drift of the hydrogen concentration in the final weeks of the run is likely due to drift in the GC calibration: drift in the butane flow controller would have manifested itself in the redundant Coriolis meter (FT903 in the plot), which in fact remained steady through this episode; and gas mass flow controllers are generally not subject to drift, although this cannot be ruled out.
The feed composition will be further scrutinized in the section on mass balance below.
Product distributions
Trends of product distributions from the three reactors, along with their inlet and outlet temperatures, are qualitatively summarized below; they will be analyzed in more detail in subsequent sections of this report. The ethane selectivities plotted in the graphs below are molar carbon selectivities, which are quantitatively similar to mass selectivities.

[bookmark: _Ref13834960]Figure 6. Composition trends of the effluent from the first reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet temperatures.
Figure 6 shows the trends for the first reactor. Due to GC configuration problems, data is missing through the middle part of the run, after restart following flow controller replacement. As noted before, the results in the first half of the run were affected by unsteady feed control. One point to note about this early phase of the run is the decrease in space velocity around May 7, accompanied by a slight reduction in feed temperature (from 400°C to 395°C).  In this reactor, the effects of these changes are largely positive: the ethane selectivity remained about the same, while the methane concentration in the effluent decreased; these effects are obvious even in the context of rather noisy overall trends, and significant swings in the hydrogen concentration.
The results for the final few weeks show a steady conversion of the butanes, at a high but incomplete level (75-80% overall conversion). The predominant product is propane at ~25%, with ethane at ~14% and methane at ~7%. The variability of the hydrogen measurements is striking. This cannot be (entirely) attributed to GC analytical issues, because the total of the GC concentrations (not shown in the plot) exhibits a smaller degree of fluctuation. Hence, there appears to be a real variation of hydrogen, with hydrogen concentration going high when ethane/butane go low and vice versa. Variations are much larger than those seen in the feed composition (see section above), so they can also not be (entirely) attributed to feed composition fluctuations. The only other plausible source of fluctuation is variability in the rates of reaction occurring across the catalyst, or in the total flow passing through the reactor. Neither can be readily explained, but must be considered in more in-depth analysis of the results. The concentrations of aromatics in this stream are too small to be plotted (total <0.1%); apparently aromatics are not readily formed, even at relatively high temperature, when the hydrogen concentration is still high. Pentane is also observed at a low level (0.2-0.3%).

[bookmark: _Ref13835008]Figure 7. Composition trends of the effluent from the second reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet temperatures.
Figure 7 shows the trends for the second reactor. Most of the butanes remaining after the first reactor are now converted (~96% conversion), and the process of converting propane to ethane is well underway. As was the case for the first reactor, the initial weeks of operation show noisier results – but over the course of passing through two reactors, the swings have become more muted, making the results more conducive to interpretation. The downward change in space velocity on May 7 is here seen to be neutral: ethane selectivity remains close to its previous value, and the beneficial effect on methane concentration evident in the first-reactor results is no longer observed, which means that relative rate of methane production vs. ethane production through the second reactor must have actually increased. The cause for this is not clear, since temperature levels were slightly lowered around the time the space velocity was decreased.
Focusing on the final weeks of operation, we see relatively steady performance. Hydrogen concentration in the effluent is still noisy, but the variability is lower than that of the first reactor. Ethane concentrations are also fairly noisy, but the calculated ethane selectivity shows less variability (44-46%); this is consistent with the notion that hydrogen and hydrocarbon concentrations swing in opposite directions, as discussed above. Methane is now a prominent product, almost as abundant as propane in the effluent. Aromatics production has increased, with total BTX concentration reaching around 0.25% (1.2% carbon selectivity), while pentane is no longer present in appreciable concentration.
[image: ]
[bookmark: _Ref13835049]Figure 8. Composition trends of the effluent from the third reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet temperatures.
Figure 8 shows the trends for the third reactor. Compared to the second reactor, butanes conversion has increased, but is still incomplete (98%). Both ethane and methane have increased in concentration, at the expense of propane, but the additional conversion is limited. Ethane selectivity increased to 52-53%, with further decreased noise in the calculated value. Aromatics selectivity shows a slight uptick, to 1.4%. The net effect of this third reactor is small compared to the first and second reactors, which appears to be inconsistent with the observed temperature rise, which is intermediate between the rises seen in the first and second reactors. This will be further explored below.
Catalyst stability
Looking at the composition trends in the final weeks of operation (06-Figure 8), no clear progression towards lower conversion or selectivity can be discerned. The trends display some gentle multi-day swings, but these move in both directions; the final product (reactor 3 effluent) appears to be especially steady, with hardly any movement in ethane yield over the course of three weeks.
The relative stability at the end of the campaign might be attributed to the fact that the fraction of active sites that had especially high activity and were most prone to deactivation had already declined in activity before the onset of this episode of steady operation (indeed, at the beginning of the full run). The majority of the catalyst had been in place since February, and had seen multiple startups and runs of a combined duration of 32 days before run 5 was started.
In extended life testing in bench-scale reactors, Heng Shou demonstrated hydrocracking catalyst performance over several months onstream. In these experiments, conducted at conditions similar to those at SwRI (WHSV=2 hr-1, H2:HC=1, P=100 psig) overall ethane yield could be maintained, but this required gradual increases in the imposed reactor temperature throughout the run – even after a few months onstream – from around 435°C to >500°C. The observed lack of continued deactivation in the pilot trials appears to contrast with this previous study, so it is worthwhile exploring differences between the studies. 
The bench-scale reactor experiments were conducted in a mostly isothermal fashion – some temperature increase was observed near the front end of the bed, but this was much smaller than the adiabatic temperature rise. Also, in the smaller reactors, the entire conversion was accomplished in a single reactor, rather than in a sequence of three reactors. In an adiabatic reactor conducting an exothermic reaction, a small change in catalyst activity may be magnified because of the self-accelerating nature of the reaction kinetics. From this point of view, we would expect adiabatic reactors whose feed temperature is maintained constant to be more, not less, sensitive to deactivation. On the other hand, it is possible that some aspects of the reaction kinetics are self-limiting as temperatures increase, perhaps because of an equilibrium condition arising within the reaction network; in this case, the adiabatic reactor will tend to produce similar results even as the catalyst activity changes. This is conjecture – the mechanisms considered in kinetic modeling do not provide for such a self-limiting temperature effect.
Comparing the SwRI reactors to the bench reactor, a similar overall space velocity was maintained in a much longer total catalyst bed length (4 m vs. 10 cm), resulting in much higher linear velocities (90 cm/s in SwRI reactor 1, vs. 6 mm/s at bench scale), which in turn give rise to higher heat and mass transfer coefficients (gas-to-catalyst and gas-to-wall), and less propensity for axial dispersion of heat and mass. However, even at the bench scale the velocity is high enough to minimize the effect of axial dispersion (Pe of the order of 50), so the latter effect should not be important. The possibility of external mass transfer limitations between bulk gas and catalyst was evaluated for lab-scale reactors (with similar or even smaller bed lengths), and found not to be significant. So although there is quite a difference in operating conditions at the two scales, both should conform to pseudo-homogeneous plug flow reactor behavior; there is no obvious reason why one set of conditions should promote more rapid deactivation than the other.
The feeds to the bench scale reactor and the SwRI units were both 70/30 normal/iso with nominal 99.5+% purity; while detailed impurity profiles are not available, it seems unlikely that the feed quality was a significant differentiating factor between the experimental results, especially since the primary deactivation mechanism is believed to be deposition of coke produced from precursors formed in the reaction network, rather than poisoning by feed components.

Reactor unloading and catalyst characterization
Following a controlled shutdown of the reactor system at the end of run 5, the catalyst was unloaded from each of the reactors, using a vacuum to extract the catalyst layer-wise from the top. The loading details were used to determine the layer depths, in an attempt to collect separately the top and bottom inert layers and three catalyst fractions of approximately equal size, for further analysis. It was not possible to perfectly segregate inert from catalyst in this procedure (see Figure 9); each of they layers was visually inspected and photographed, weighed to infer mass gain/loss, and samples retained for analysis. Since the inert material is much denser than the catalyst, even a small volume fraction may translate to a larger weight fraction. 
This makes it difficult to compare the loaded weights to the extracted weights for individual layers; the comparison of total weight (inert plus catalyst) is more meaningful. The table below shows the results of unloading, along with the initial weights loaded.

The sample weights indicate a net increase in weight of the materials in all three reactors: 77 g, 196 g, and 107 g, respectively. The most likely source of the extra weight is deposition of coke, which is consistent with the observed color of the extracted materials: some of the inert particles were a darker gray than the fresh material, and the catalyst particles had turned from white to dark gray (top layer) or black (bottom layer), as shown in the photos of Figure 10.
Each of the samples (except for the top inert layer in R101, which appears to have been overlooked) was subjected to carbon/hydrogen/nitrogen elemental analysis at SwRI using ASTM method D5291. Only carbon was found in sufficient concentration to report; the analytical results, in terms of wt% carbon based on total mass of sample, are included in the table above, along with the calculated carbon weights. Very little coke was found on the inert material, with higher accumulations on the catalyst. The sum of these weights for each of the reactors is in the same ballpark as the total weight pickup, but the mass balance isn’t particularly good, and deviates downward in R301 and R101, upward in R201. This may be attributed to measurement errors during both loading and unloading, as well as uncertainty in the analytical results (each sample was analyzed in duplicate, with 1-24% difference between the analyses). It is also possible that some weight was lost due to crushing or erosion of the catalyst particles, but no evidence of significant fines accumulation downstream (e.g., on filter upstream of pressure control valve) was observed. 
The coke accumulation results are similar to those reported by Heng Shou from bench reactor results after one month onstream[footnoteRef:2], both in terms of absolute accumulations and the progression of coke deposition with length along reactor. This was not necessarily expected: the bench reactors operated fairly isothermally, with a maximum temperature attained in the top half of the catalyst bed, while the pilot reactors showed a continuous progression towards higher temperatures along the reactor. From the bench reactor results, we might have expected that degree of conversion (which determines hydrogen concentration) was the primary correlating factor for coke deposition rate. However, in the pilot reactors the coke deposition was consistently low near the front ends of the reactors, even though the conversion [2:  H. Shou et al, Metal-acid bifunctional catalyst for butanes hydrocracking, STCH-2019-001, 2019, p9.]

level was much higher in the third reactor than in the first – so temperature appears to play a more important role than conversion.
It is impossible to say whether coke deposition occurred gradually across the time onstream of the catalyst, or occurred predominantly in the early stages of the catalyst’s exposure to process conditions. The relative stability of catalyst performance with time toward the end of the run suggests that any continued coke laydown had at most a minor incremental effect on catalytic reaction rates.
When related to the process feed rates, the accumulation of coke is insignificant: the total weight gain for all three reactors, averaged across the duration of the run, amounts to 0.35 g/h, compared to 8-10 kg/h butane feed. Hence, when evaluating mass balance (see below), the effect of coke deposition can be ignored.
Mass balance
The consistency of the run data can be assessed using various mass balance approaches. The simplest one is based on total flows as measured by the two Coriolis flowmeters and the two hydrogen mass flow controllers: the mass balance may be expressed as the ratio of the effluent Coriolis flow divided by the sum of the inlet flows (on a mass basis). The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 11. 
The calculations suggest that, after initial flow issues were resolved, the mass balance was reasonably well satisfied, especially during the middle part of the run; the source of the sudden decrease in measured outlet flow around June 6, causing a negative deviation from mass balance, is not understood, but is unlikely to be due to sudden onset of excessive coking or other phenomena that would physically prevent material entering the system from being measured in the outlet. During the preceding period, there is a

[bookmark: _Ref13836570]Figure 12. Trends of nitrogen concentration measured in the feed and in the effluents of reactors 1 and 3. Feed hydrogen and n-butane concentrations are also shown.
pronounced day/night cycle to the mass balance, arising from a corresponding cycle in the outlet flow data. Since Coriolis instruments are true mass flow meters, this cannot be readily explained by temperature correction effects. Taking the average of the cycles, there is a positive deviation from mass balance through this period of 1.5%, which is within the range of instrument error. Hence, the outlet flow is in reasonable agreement with the inlet flow, which should hold not only for the overall mass, but also for the individual elements. This observation will be used in evaluating the elemental mass balances below.
The nitrogen entering with the butane is observed in GC analysis of feed and effluent samples, as previously discussed in the section on butane delivery. The trends are plotted in Figure 12.
The concentration measured in the feed is consistently higher than the ones measured in the reactor effluents (which among themselves are quite consistent), by a factor of about 1.4. For elemental nitrogen balance to hold, the volumetric outlet flow would therefore need to be about 40% higher than the inlet flow. Some volume expansion is expected, because the formation of unsaturated compounds (olefins and aromatics) results in an increase in the number of moles, according to:

However, based on the outlet composition from reactor 3, this expansion factor should be less than 1.02. Therefore, the difference in measured outlet concentrations must be due to GC error; this is not unreasonable since the feed composition is measured on one GC while effluent compositions are
[image: ]
[bookmark: _Ref13836637]Figure 13. Trends of hydrogen/carbon elemental ratio derived from GC measurements of feed and reactor effluent compositions, and from feed flow meter/controller data.
measured on the other, and calibration for nitrogen, a minor inert species, was probably not as rigorous as for the reactant and product species. Unfortunately, this means that nitrogen cannot be used as an internal standard in mass balance calculations.
The other elements present are hydrogen and carbon. It is instructive to look at the ratio between these elements, since this should not change as long as everything entering the reactor exits, and also compensates for effects of sample pressure or flow that affect all species proportionally. This analysis is shown in Figure 13.
An equimolar mixture of hydrogen and butane has an H/C ratio of 3, and indeed throughout the run the feed composition evaluated to a ratio not too far from this value, with day/night variations as mentioned before. The ratio in all three of the effluent samples is significantly higher, by about 7%. The three effluent compositions are among themselves fairly consistent in H/C, and show the same qualitative trends as the feed sample does, albeit with greater amplitude of the variations. One possible explanation for the difference in H/C values is that carbon is lost from the reaction mixture by coking. However, the amount of carbon deposition required to explain the difference is large, and inconsistent with the reasonable overall mass balance demonstrated above as well as the small measured coke deposition relative to feed flows. Furthermore, we would expect to see a progressively larger deviation of the H/C ratio through the reactors, as more carbon is laid down in each – but this is not observed in Figure 13. Similar objections apply to the hypothesis that heavies in the reactor effluent samples (relatively rich in carbon) are not analyzed by the GC (either because they condense before reaching the GC or because they don’t elute from the column): very little condensate is observed in the knockout pot, and the concentrations of removed heavies (not pure carbon) required to explain the elemental imbalance are quite large.
It appeared likely, then, that GC analysis was again to blame for the lack of mass balance. In this case, however, we were justified in having greater confidence in the accuracy of the GC results, since the components most strongly affecting the ratio are the primary feeds and products of the process, and therefore well covered by the calibration procedures. When the discrepancy was noticed as the run was proceeding, additional calibrations and checks were carried out to identify the source of the issue – but the analytical results on calibration standards were rather consistent. It is difficult to envision a way in which the analytical method for the second GC could be off while producing consistent results among the three effluent samples – hydrogen, which tends to be the most variable component and which strongly influences the H/C ratio, is quite different in the effluent of the first reactor vs. that of the third. The more likely culprit is the first GC: it only analyzes the feed composition, which remains relatively constant throughout the run. A persistent error in the results from this GC could most easily explain the H/C imbalance. Alternatively, the sample analyzed by the GC, drawn from the process not very far downstream of the hydrogen/butane mixing point, may not represent the fully mixed composition; because of the particular hydrodynamics a somewhat consistent error may result. 
Assigning the mass balance issue to problems with feed analysis is also somewhat consistent with the H/C ratio derived from the butane feed Coriolis meter and the two hydrogen mass flow controllers, also plotted in Figure 13. The trend is quantitatively closest to the trends derived from the second GC for most of the run, although none of the GC-derived trends align closely with the flowmeter-derived trend during the final weeks of operation.
The balance of the evidence supports the assumption that the GC feed composition is the least reliable of the measurements, even if no direct evidence from calibration and troubleshooting could be found. Hence, in subsequent analysis, the feed composition will be derived from the product composition by mass balance, rather than taken from the feed GC results. Practically, this means that we assign a hydrogen/butane feed ratio of 1.05-1.1.
Heat balance
The aim of the pilot reactor operation is to simulate adiabatic operation by compensating heat loss to the environment with localized heat input from reactor zone heaters. The operating and control mode to accomplish this was described in a previous section. The effectiveness of implementation can be checked after the fact using measured inlet and outlet compositions and temperatures, by straightforward thermodynamic calculations. This was done for the conditions prevailing during the final weeks of the run, with steady performance; the procedure and results are reported here.
First, the compositions of the effluents from the three reactors were averaged over the eight-day interval from June 4-11, and normalized on a nitrogen-free basis (nitrogen at 0.5 vol% would not meaningfully change calculated outlet temperatures). The H/C ratios for all three averaged effluent compositions were quite similar (3.243, 3.240, 3.246), which means the mass balances across the second and third reactors could be made to close almost exactly. As discussed above, the H/C ratio for the feed samples was much lower, so the feed to the first reactor was instead calculated based on the H/C ratio, to force closure of the elemental mass balances.
This provided inlet and outlet compositions for each of the reactors. A set of eight stoichiometric reactions were defined to allow interconversion between the ten species considered (H2, C1-C5 aliphatics, propylene, butenes, and toluene), where toluene was used to lump all BTX species, and isomers were lumped except for n-butane and isobutane. Through a straightforward Excel goal seek process, the extents of each of these reactions were determined that most closely reproduced the conversion from given inlet composition to given outlet composition. These reaction extents, along with inlet composition and temperature, were then used in an Aspen Plus simulation with a single RSTOIC reactor to calculate the temperature of the outlet stream. The calculated temperatures can then be compared to the measured catalyst bed outlet temperatures, evaluated from the point in each of the multipoint thermocouples that is in the inert layer below the catalyst but still within the heated zone of the reactor. The results for the three reactors are as follows:

The deviation from adiabatic performance is appreciable for the first two reactors, but is particularly striking for the third reactor. This was evident throughout the run; in fact the external temperatures for the bottom three reactor zones were maintained below the corresponding internal temperatures to partly offset the obvious thermal imbalance. Even with this attempt at correction, the temperature rise across the third reactor was far greater than can be explained by the heat of reaction. 
Figure 14 shows temperature profiles measured along the multi-point internal themocouples for each of the reactors during the period of stable operation toward the end of the run. The horizontal scale is the length along the catalyst bed (top of bed at zero); the extents of the active catalyst zones in each of the reactors are indicated by the dashed vertical lines. This plot confirms that reactors 1 and 2 adhere better to the adiabatic ideal than reactor 3: their profiles upstream and downstream of the catalyst zone are relatively flat, taking the majority of the overall temperature increase across just the catalyst bed. In reactor 3, on the other hand, the temperature rises by 50°C even before the top of the catalyst bed; the bottom end of the reactor is better behaved, with only a slight additional rise after the active layer.

It appears likely that the thermocouples used in the adiabatic temperature control scheme for reactor 3 had a systematic error: if either the external thermocouples read too low, or the internal ones read too high, the heater controls would be driven to produce a situation where the external temperatures exceeded the internals ones, leading to a net heat input into the reactor and therefore super-adiabatic behavior. However, it is not obvious why such a systematic error should exist: the internal multipoint thermocouple was purchased and installed at the same time as those for the other two reactors (in late 2018), while several of the external thermocouples were replaced during overhauls of the reactor heaters at various points during the piloting trials. The process temperature measured downstream of the third reactor (TE-208) averaged 519°C, about 30°C below the measured catalyst bed temperature (which is consistent with heat loss observed downstream of the first reactor) and well above the calculated outlet temperature – so the discrepancy certainly cannot be attributed solely to internal temperature measurement.
 The most likely explanation is that the external thermocouples, despite being springloaded to contact the reactor wall, were placed such that they did not measure the hottest wall temperatures due to the relative layout of the reactor heaters, reactor, and thermocouples. The third reactor is different from the other two in that the heaters are metallic with quite different dynamics (slower) and likely different effectiveness of heat transfer than the ceramic heaters.
The exact cause for the net heat influx may never be known with confidence; in any case, it is clear that the results from the third reactor must be interpreted in the light of quite non-adiabatic thermal performance. Even the deviations of the first two reactors are large enough to require some adjustment in further analysis relative to the simple adiabatic assumption. In modeling efforts, net heat will need to be added or subtracted from the process gas to match the observed outlet temperature; this heat can be found using a variation of the Aspen simulation described above, and is included in the table above.

Comparison against reactor model
A reaction network and kinetic model had been developed based on extensive laboratory testing data before the pilot campaign was conducted. A straightforward reactor model (sequence of adiabatic plug flow reactors) was constructed in MATLAB, and used to define the process conditions expected to produce favorable results in the pilot plant: high conversion and >55% ethane yield while avoiding overly high temperatures in any of the reactors. At a space velocity of 4 kgbutane/kgcath, suggested reactor inlet temperatures were 450°C, 465°C, and 480°C. The predicted profiles for this case are shown in Figure 15.
The kinetic model had been developed using the original formulation of bifunctional catalyst (corresponding to Zeolyst product code ZD15015A from catalyst table above, with SAR=50); for the majority of the runs in the campaign, including run 5, the newer formulation (SAR=30, product code ZD18029) was used, which in laboratory testing had shown better performance, especially characterized by higher reaction rates at low temperature, as exemplified by results in table below.

To compare pilot trial results with predictions from the reactor model, the non-adiabatic performance of the reactors must be taken into account. The previous section quantified the net heat applied to the process gas by the reactor heaters based on thermodynamic calculations. The heat balance in the MATLAB reactor model was extended to include a heat input term, which is distributed uniformly across the length of the reactor. For positive net heat (reactors 1 and 3), this term will not only result in a direct increase in the predicted reactor outlet temperature, but also an indirect increase due to the higher rate of reaction; the opposite holds for reactor 2, with negative net heat.
When the feed composition and space velocity, reactor inlet temperatures, and net heat flows for the SwRI reactor system (taken from steady performance during final weeks of run 5) are used as inputs to the MATLAB model, the profiles shown in Figure 16 are obtained.
These profiles do not resemble the ones observed during the actual pilot trial: overall conversion and ethane yield are greatly underpredicted, mostly because the model predicts very low reaction rates at the 395°C inlet temperature to the first reactor; the modeled temperature rise through this reactor is almost entirely due to the applied net heat. Conversions and temperature rises through the subsequent reactors are higher, but even here, rates are underpredicted: unlike in the pilot runs, modeled reactor exit temperatures remain well below 500°C. 
One of the reasons for the discrepancy between model and experimental results is the different catalyst used. The newer catalyst variant was selected partly for its higher activity, which is especially apparent in the low temperature range. However, this cannot fully explain the difference. In this context, experimental results were examined that had been obtained in laboratory reactors under non-differential conditions over a wide range of temperatures (375-475°C). These experiments were not part of the data set used for

kinetic model development, but are relevant because they probe to lower temperatures than were studied in the kinetics experiments. Experiments at identical conditions were conducted for the original SAR-50 catalyst and the new SAR-30 catalyst. The experimental hydrocarbon conversion results are plotted in Figure 17, along with model predictions. The model clearly underpredicts the results for both catalysts at low temperature, while providing reasonable predictions at temperatures above 450°C. The same trends (deviation at low temperature, reasonable fit at high temperature) hold for other variables besides conversion.
The experimental results suggest a much lower effective activation energy than is implicit in the model. The temperature dependence of the model is complex: the activation energy of the primary butane conversion pathways, which proceed via butene intermediates, is very low, but the rates rise quickly with temperature because the dehydrogenation equilibrium is governed by its endothermic heat of reaction. At low temperatures, very low concentrations of olefins are present, leading to a low rate of the main reaction step (which is second order in butene concentration).
Therefore, adjusting the kinetic model to account for the higher activity at low temperature will require more than a straightforward adjustment of one or more activation energies. Reaction orders and perhaps the reaction network itself may need to be modified to allow accurate representation of kinetics across the entire temperature range of interest. The integral experiments discussed above would be a useful input into such an extension of the kinetic modeling, but it is likely that additional data at more differential reaction conditions would be required to validate and support the updated model. The costs of such an effort would need to be balanced against the perceived need for an accurate hydrocracking reactor model. For back-of-the-envelope calculations, a detailed model is likely not required; the model could likely be adjusted to accurately predict a subset of integral conversion results near anticipated operating conditions (including the low-temperature results above), even if its predictive ability would be poor for conditions further away from the likely operating points. Of course this would still apply only to the SAR-50 catalyst – not enough data is available for the SAR-30 catalyst to build even a moderately predictive model.
Conclusions
Butane hydrocracking over Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst was demonstrated in a configuration of three reactors in series, operated in simulated adiabatic mode. After considerable performance and reliability issues with the the originally designed apparatus were addressed by equipment redesign, several extended-length runs were conducted; four runs, totaling 77 days on stream, were conducted using the final catalyst loading of the improved SAR-30 catalyst formulation. 
Through commissioning activities and extended runs, the hydrocracking catalyst system was found to be robust and resilient. It was much less sensitive to runaway than the hydrogenolysis catalyst system, with temperature rises across reactors of 100°C maintained without excessive variability.
The final run, lasting 45 days, was carried out at relatively constant operating conditions (space velocity 2.3 h-1, hydrogen/butane molar ratio=1, 100 psig, reactor inlet temperatures selected to produce ~520°C outlet temperatures), with especially steady operation during the final weeks. An overall ethane carbon yield about 52% was maintained. No progressive catalyst deactivation was observed during this interval, although coke accumulations of 3-16 wt% were observed in post-run catalyst analysis.
The simulated adiabatic operating mode was moderately successful for the first two reactors, while the third reactor experienced a much higher temperature rise than would be expected at adiabatic operation. This is attributed to problems measuring heater/wall temperatures in this reactor. 
The measured conversions, especially in the first reactor, were found to be much higher than values predicted using the previously developed kinetics and reactor model, mostly due to higher activity at low temperature. This is only partly attributed to the newer, more active catalyst used in the pilot runs. More low-temperature data would need to be acquired to adjust the hydrocracking kinetic model for better predictive power across the entire temperature range.

Title: Butane hydrocracking pilot trials at Southwest Research Institute 

Project: Butane to Ethane 

Authors: Robert Broekhuis 

 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A three-reactor hydrotreating apparatus at Southwest Research Institute was reconfigured to conduct a 
pilot trial of SABIC’s bifunctional hydrocracking catalyst to convert a mixed butanes feed to a mixture of 
predominantly lighter hydrocarbons, rich in ethane. The reactors were operated in a simulated adiabatic 
mode, with electric heaters compensating for heat losses, to allow the temperature profiles through the 
reactors to approximate those expected in a commercial adiabatic reactor. Feed temperatures to each of 
the reactors were controlled individually to achieve suitable overall conversion and selectivity. 

Reconfiguration and commissioning of the reactor system took more time than anticipated, leaving less 
time for continuous operation than originally envisioned, but steady and reliable operation was eventually 
attained. Four runs, totaling 77 days on stream, were conducted using the final catalyst loading of an 
improved catalyst formulation with low Si/Al ratio. The final run, lasting 45 days, was carried out at 
relatively constant operating conditions (space velocity 2.3 h-1, hydrogen/butane molar ratio=1, 100 psig, 
reactor inlet temperatures selected to produce ~520°C outlet temperatures), with especially steady 
operation during the final weeks. An overall ethane carbon yield about 52% was maintained. No 
progressive catalyst deactivation was observed during this interval, although coke accumulations of 3-16 
wt% were observed in post-run catalyst analysis. 

Thermodynamic analysis of operating data reveals that the simulated adiabatic operating mode was 
moderately successful for the first two reactors, while the third reactor experienced a much higher 
temperature rise than would be expected at adiabatic operation. This is attributed to problems measuring 
heater/wall temperatures in this reactor, and had to be corrected for in subsequent reactor modeling.  

The measured conversions, especially in the first reactor, were found to be much higher than values 
predicted using a previously developed reactor model, mostly due to higher activity at low temperature. 
This is partly attributed to the newer, more active catalyst used in the pilot runs, but also indicates that 
more low-temperature data would need to be acquired to adjust the hydrocracking kinetic model for better 
predictive power across the entire temperature range.

Background 
Processes to convert a mixed butane feed to a product mix rich in ethane are being developed in CRD, as 
a possible means of alleviating ethane feedstock shortages in Saudi Arabia. The R&D program, conducted 
by a team in the Feedstocks & Energy Department at STCH, initially built on earlier development of a 
bifunctional catalyst developed to conduct mild hydrocracking of heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks. 
Laboratory performance trials confirmed that variations of this catalyst were capable of fully converting a 
stream comprising both n-butane and isobutane, producing a product with ethane as its primary 
component, with propane and methane as secondary products. The catalyst is platinum on a ZSM-5 
zeolite; the specific composition was optimized in early laboratory trials, during which nominal operating 
conditions were also established (space velocities ranging from 2-4 kg/kgcath, hydrogen-to-butane ratio 
around 1, temperatures from 430-480°C, pressure around 100 psig). These early studies were followed up 
with catalyst life testing in larger bench-scale reactors, which confirmed adequate catalyst life and 
established methods for periodic catalyst regeneration. 

The desired chemistry is moderately exothermic, resulting in an adiabatic temperature rise for full 
conversion in the vicinity of 200°C for typical operating conditions. The lab and bench scale reactors 
were not operated adiabatically: the lab reactors were nearly isothermal, while the bench scale reactors 
exhibited a limited axial temperature gradient near the front end of the catalyst bed. The commercial 
process concept to manage heat of reaction is a sequence of adiabatic reactors with interstage cooling; to 
demonstrate this concept, pilot-scale testing at near-adiabatic conditions is required. 

A second catalyst system, promoting hydrogenolysis at a lower temperature range, was developed while 
experimentation with the hydrocracking catalyst was ongoing. This catalyst was found to produce a 
product slate with a higher selectivity towards ethane, but converted primarily n-butane, leaving most 
isobutane in the product stream. When suitable process schemes had been defined to accomplish the full 
conversion of a mixed butanes stream with the hydrogenolysis catalyst, this system was found to have the 
most favorable process economics, and therefore became the front-runner for further development. 
However, because certain aspects of both catalyst systems, such as catalyst life and regenerability, 
remained items of technical risk, it was decided to proceed with piloting both catalyst systems and 
associated process concepts in parallel. Two piloting locations were identified: an existing pilot reactor 
system previously used for naphtha hydrocracking at STCG, and a hydrotreating reactor system available 
at Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, TX). The former, having been extensively developed and 
demonstrated for the previous project, was selected to pilot the frontrunner hydrogenolysis catalyst; pilot 
testing is ongoing, and will be documented in a separate report. The latter was used to pilot the 
bifunctional hydrocracking catalyst; this is the subject of the current report. 

The objectives of the pilot trials were 1) to demonstrate the performance of the hydrocracking catalyst 
system when operated under adiabatic conditions at the operating conditions established during laboratory 
testing, 2) to identify any sources of technical risk and if possible identify mitigating approaches, and 3) 
to confirm stability of the catalyst system over durations of 1-3 months, consistent with bench-scale 
studies. Additional objectives that were tentatively defined included longer operation for extended life 
testing along with implementation of in-situ regeneration strategies. However, by the time the initial 
objectives had been addressed, piloting of the hydrogenolysis catalyst system had proven largely 
successful; since technical risks of the front-runner concept appeared to be quite manageable, it was 
decided to not pursue the follow-on studies for the hydrocracking catalyst.

Project timeline 
The piloting plan was based on a proposal from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). Equipment 
modifications and commissioning were slated to commence in late summer of 2018, followed by three 
months of continuous operation to extend into early 2019. Due to the timing of other-customer projects at 
SwRI, the initial phase was somewhat delayed, and required rather more elapsed time when it became 
clear that the equipment and controls modifications required to establish reliable continuous operation 
were most extensive than anticipated. Even after initial reliability problems had been resolved, the reactor 
system required several additional overhauls after testing commenced in late 2018. Multiple short runs (2-
3 days) were conducted in December 2018 and January 2019 to establish the start-up procedures and align 
instrumentation and analytical. Following these commissioning efforts, several longer runs were 
conducted, still interrupted by shutdowns and equipment upgrades as progress was made towards higher 
reliability. As a result, continuous operation time was divided among several shorter runs, listed in the 
following table (catalyst load designations are explained in the corresponding section below): 

Run Dates Operating days Catalyst load 
1 1/31/19 – 2/5/19 5 B 
2 2/21/19 – 3/1/19 7 C

4 4/1/19 – 4/17/19 14 D 
5 4/26/19 - 6/13/19 45 D 

 

The final run was completed after modifications to significantly improve reliability of the preheaters, and 
was by far the longest, with significant time of operation at steady conditions. Most of this report will 
focus on this final run. 

Equipment configuration 

Overall system summary 
The pilot trials were conducted in a pre-existing hydrotreating apparatus, used by SwRI as a general-
purpose packed-bed reactor system for a variety of projects. The core of the apparatus consists of three

The reactors are arranged in series, with downflow through each reactor. Because of the high flowrates 
and specific project requirements, much of the interconnecting tubing and auxiliary equipment was 
reconfigured or built afresh relative to previous projects. A mixed butanes feed (70% n-butane, 30% 
isobutane) was provided as a custom mixture in a tank truck (Matheson Trigas, 99.5+%), with driving 
pressure from a nitrogen pad maintained in the tank headspace; the liquid butane stream was dosed using 
a liquid volumetric flow controller, with secondary mass flow measurement by a Coriolis flowmeter, and 
vaporized/preheated through a sequence of electrically heated preheating pipes. Hydrogen was delivered

from a tube trailer, through gas mass flow controllers, and also electrically preheated. Hydrogen and 
butane streams were mixed in a simple tee upstream of the first reactor. The system was designed to allow 
operation at a space velocity of 4 kgbutane/kgcath, although lower throughputs were maintained in the actual 
runs. 

The inlet temperatures to each of the reactors were maintained by electrical heat tracing applied to the 
inlet tubing. Although gas coolers were originally installed as interstage coolers between R301 and R101 
and between R101 and R201, these were removed early on since ambient heat loss was high enough to 
provide the required cooling. A gas cooler was maintained downstream of R201 and upstream of the main 
pressure control valve; downstream of this valve, the effluent was cooled in a knockout pot equipped with 
a cooling coil. The effluent flow was measured using a Coriolis flowmeter before being sent to a flare.  

Two GCs were configured to analyze a total of four sample streams: the mixed inlet stream, and the 
effluents from each of the reactors. The instruments were identically configured with three injector-
column-detector trains (1 FID, 2 TCDs) to allow analysis of inorganic gases (H2, N2, O2, CO, CO2) and 
organics from methane through C10 hydrocarbons. In most of the runs, the first GC was dedicated to the 
inlet stream, while the second GC alternated between the three effluent streams. 

The overall system was controlled using an OPTO PLC system interfaced with an iFix front end. The unit 
was approved for unattended operation, and was generally monitored during working hours on weekdays. 

Appendix A contains the P&IDs for the system as finally configured for Run 5. Several subsystems of 
specific importance are further discussed in sections below. 

Butane delivery train 
As mentioned, the mixed butanes stream was delivered from a nitrogen-padded large tanker. The pad 
pressure was maintained using nitrogen from a nearby cryogenic tank with vaporizer. It fluctuated 
somewhat with day/night cycles as well as usage patterns from other users of the nitrogen supply, but was 
generally between 130 and 160 psig, sufficient to provide butane to the reactor system operated at a 
downstream pressure of 100 psig. 

The use of nitrogen resulted in a non-neglible amount of dissolved nitrogen traveling with the butane feed 
to the reactors; it was consistently measured by the GCs in both inlet and outlet compositions, at levels 
between 0.5 and 1 vol% in the mixed hydrogen/butanes stream, which is qualitatively consistent with the 
solubility of nitrogen in butanes. The butane tank was refilled in April, just before the start of run 5; this 
resulted in an initially low nitrogen content in the feed, increasing over 10 days as headspace nitrogen 
slowly dissolved into the butane towards an equilibrium value (see Figure 12 below). 

As ambient temperatures increased in the spring, instabilities started arising in the butane flow delivery, 
evident from both the liquid flow controller performance (characterized by wild fluctuations) and the 
density readout from the secondary Coriolis flowmeter (which dropped below the liquid density of 
butane). The malperformance was attributed to the formation of bubbles in the liquid butane feed, 
predominantly consisting of nitrogen (at the feed pressure, the bubble point of the mixed butanes stream 
itself was well above any ambient temperature). Stored butane, remaining at relatively constant 
temperature in the large storage tank, would increase in temperature as it traveled through several tens of 
feet of tubing towards the reactor system, and also undergo a slight decrease in pressure; both are

conducive to the formation of a small amount of vapor phase. Once this problem was recognized, it was 
remediated by including a small heat exchanger with chilled water as coolant just upstream of the 
flowmeter/flow controller. These modifications resulted in generally stable feed performance. 

In the original system configuration, butane vaporization and preheating was accomplished in a sequence 
of three vertical upflow preheaters, each consisting of an empty 1-inch pipe wrapped with high-
temperature electrical heat tracing. While this system had shown adequate heat transfer characteristics in 
nitrogen flow testing, it proved inadequate for reliably delivering a heated butane vapor stream. 
Temperatures measured in the first heater, where most of the vaporization took place, fluctuated with wild 
swings, suggesting periodic operation, e.g. surging or slugging dynamics. More importantly, measured 
mixed feed compositions showed a great deal of variability in the hydrogen-to-butanes ratio, which was 
also indicative of non-steady flow conditions. 

Two measures were taken to improve performance: first, the heaters were filled with packing material 
constructed of stainless steel mesh, to improve heat transfer and improve hydrodynamics. Following this 
change, the temperature fluctuations were no longer observed, but the feed compositions continued to 
show a good deal of variability. Next, the hydrogen feed system was reconfigured to introduce a portion 
of the hydrogen into the butanes stream upstream of the vaporizer/preheater, using a second mass flow 
controller. This hydrogen promotes earlier vaporization of the butanes (avoiding cyclic superheating) and 
acts as a carrier to suppress non-steady hydrodynamics. After some optimization, it was found that with 
about 20% of the total hydrogen stream introduced upstream, the variability of feed composition was 
greatly reduced. 

While this system performed competently after these modifications, the coiled heat tracing cables 
providing the heat in the vaporizer/preheater were found to be prone to failure even though they were 
rated for operation at higher temperature. When these failures had resulted in premature shutdown of 
several runs, it was decided to overhaul the system, replacing the heat tracing with a series of 
conventional ceramic clamshell heaters before startup of run 5. This modification was successful, 
allowing the final run to complete without further interruptions.

Figure 1. Trends of temperatures and heater outputs in the first butane vaporizer/preheater during a representative 
four-day span of run 5. 

As an illustrative example, Figure 1 plots the temperatures and heater outputs in the first vaporizer and 
preheater during a four-day span of run 5. The temperatures are well in control (internal process 
temperature TE906 is of most importance in this regard), and continue to be through the second and third 
preheaters, not shown here. Throughout this time span, the heater power varies to maintain these steady 
temperature levels. Note the periodic pattern of the TE602 temperature (in the heat-traced zone just 
upstream of the preheater). The fluctuations appear with a period of about 16 hours, which was consistent 
throughout the run; the same cyclic pattern was observed in a few other temperatures, physically quite 
removed from TE602. The source of these patterns was never elucidated, but given the lack of correlation 
with day/night cycle or ambient temperatures, it appears likely related to an artifact of the control system 
or the electrical supply. The fluctuations do not appear to propagate into the realm of reactor performance, 
so they were not considered to be a major concern. 

Reactors 
The reactor system was originally built as a hydrotreating system with a preheater and two reactors. 
Through subsequent projects, the preheater came to be used as a third reactor, resulting in the 
configuration used in the current project, with three reactors having somewhat different dimensions. All 
three are configured for high pressure (>1000 psig), with Grayloc closure systems at upstream and 
downstream ends. The stainless steel reactor tubes are enclosed in clamshell heater arrangements, with 
somewhat different equipment configuration for each of the reactors (six ceramic heaters for the first, five 
ceramic heaters for the second, and five metallic heaters for the third), resulting in different heat transfer 
dynamics. Catalyst and catalyst support particles are supported on metallic grates that are installed as part

of the bottom closure, with a multipoint thermocouple extending upward through the length of the reactor, 
with internal temperature measurement points corresponding to the centers of the heating zones. External 
temperatures were measured at the same axial positions using spring-loaded thermocouples extending 
through the heaters to the reactor surface. The reactors featured insulation typical of such heater systems, 
sufficient for personnel protection and avoidance of gross heat loss, but not nearly as effective as the 
insulation installed for the purpose-built pilot plant at STCG. Compared to the STCG system, the number 
of individually controllable zones per reactor was also much smaller. Therefore, heat losses were greater 
(especially at the upper and lower ends of the reactors), with less well-defined temperature distributions 
and not nearly as tight a temperature control as is possible at STCG. 

Conceptually, however, the control philosophy for the reactors was similar: adiabatic operation was 
approximated by using the electric heaters to just compensate for heat loss, in this case by controlling the 
difference between the internal and external thermocouples at each axial location to a zero setpoint. The 
control loops operated fairly successfully, although not with the same high fidelity as accomplished at 
STCG. For example, the difference between internal and external thermocouples fluctuated in a -3 to 
+3°C band for most of the thermocouples in the first reactor (with somewhat higher fluctuations seen in 
the bottom-most heating zone). The best control of this delta is seen in the topmost zone, which suggests 
that the fluctuations seen further downstream are likely due more to variability of flow (i.e., space 
velocity, which governs conversion and adiabatic temperature rise) than to poor performance of the 
temperature control loops themselves.  

An illustrative example of reactor temperature control is shown in Figure 2, plotting temperatures and 
outputs over a one-day interval. While the inlet temperature is controlled quite well, larger variations are 
evident at downstream thermocouples. These might be attributed to gradual variations in (total) flow or 
composition (hydrogen:butanes ratio) across the day; the external temperatures follow the internal trends 
reasonably well, but of course deviations become greater as the rate of internal temperature swing 
increases. Note also that the output of the bottom-most heater (TIC307) is much higher than that of any of 
the upstream heaters, indicative of the much higher heat loss near the bottom of the reactor, requiring a 
higher compensating heater duty. 

Although the reactor systems were old and some of the heaters displayed some age-related reliability 
problems, they performed adequately once appropriate repairs had been made, with all heaters in 
operation throughout the final run.

and red-tint trends the heater outputs. 

Catalyst loading 
Since the three reactors have different dimensions, the amounts of catalyst loaded in each are also 
different; for each, the aim was to fill the majority of the heated zone of the reactors with catalyst, leaving 
some length of inert support/heat transfer material both above and below the catalyst to avoid having 
catalyst in the parts of the reactor most affected by the greater extent of heat loss near the top and bottom 
ends. Practically, this means that about 20% of the catalyst is present in the first reactor, 35% in the 
second, and 45% in the third. Reported space velocities are always based on the total amount of catalyst 
in all three reactors; individual reactor space velocities are of course higher. 

After the initial round of commissioning, subsequent catalyst loads used Denstone 1/8” spheres (Norpro 
St. Gobain) as the inert material. The reactors were fully loaded three times: once for commissioning in 
November 2018 (A), once for initial runs in December 2018 (B), and finally for the longer runs in 
February 2019 (C). After a process upset led to high temperatures in the third reactor, the catalyst in that 
reactor was changed out in late March 2019 (D).

Figure 3. Long extrudates from catalyst batch ZD18029 

Catalyst loads A and B used catalyst from an initial shipment of two drums of extrudates produced by 
Zeolyst (ZD15015A). This was at that time the standard catalyst formulation, with 0.3% Pt on ZSM-5 
with a silica-alumina ratio (SAR) ratio of 50. Loads C and D used catalyst from a smaller batch of newly 
prepared catalyst with a lower SAR of 30 (ZD18029). Characteristics of both catalysts are presented in 
the table below.

The first catalyst was produced in a large quantity, with equipment that allowed size control of the 
extrudate lengths; the second catalyst was produced in smaller-scale equipment, with less control over the 
extrudate lengths. The resulting extrudates were longer (see Figure 3), which resulted in a lower packing 
density than for the first batch. The density of the first batch was measured using lab cylinders selected to 
have similar size as the SwRI reactors; this is the 655 kg/m3 in the table above. The density was not 
measured for the second batch, but results from catalyst loading suggest the effective packing density was 
about 20% lower. This resulted in lower catalyst amounts being loaded (to obtain same geometric 
configuration of catalyst beds) than was anticipated, and hence requiring a lower feed flowrate to achieve 
the same weight hourly space velocity. 

Weights of inert materials and catalysts loaded were recorded on catalyst load data sheets, along with the 
depth (measured from face of top flange) after each stage of loading. The catalyst load data sheets are 
included as Appendix B. Since Run 5, which used the final catalyst configuration D, will be analyzed in 
most detail below, the loading details for this configuration are summarized in the table below:

Startup and operation 
The purpose of the early runs was primarily to gain experience in startup and line-out of the reactor 
system. Early startup attempts were slow and methodical, but due to lack of experience they still 
sometimes resulted in undesired operating modes. Through the development of a well-defined startup 
protocol, it became possible to start up and line out the reactors in a controlled way, within a time span of 
two days. This protocol is described below. 

After loading the reactors and verifying the absence of leaks, hydrogen flow was established through both 
mass flow controllers (through the hydrogen heater and the butane heater) to the reactors, while nitrogen 
was introduced through the butane feed train, at the desired setpoint pressure (typically 100 psig). The 
hydrogen heater, butane heaters, and line heat tracing circuits were then brought up to manual values 
sufficient to establish a suitable initial temperature profile. Once the preheater temperatures reached a 
high enough value to support butane vaporization, butane flow was quickly ramped to its setpoint value 
and nitrogen flow stopped. Preheater controls were then set to automatic to establish a temperature profile 
along the various heaters that had previously been shown to result in smooth heatup and even distribution 
of heating load among the heaters. This initial phase of startup could be completed in about 5 hours. At its 
conclusion, the temperature and composition at the inlet of the first reactor were close to their desired 
values. 

Up to this point, the reactor heaters remained off, allowing the process gas to lose heat as it flowed 
through the reactor. Depending on feed conditions, a mild temperature increase would typically be 
observed through the first reactor, resulting from limited conversion. The next phase was the lining out of 
the reactor heaters. This was typically done in a top-down fashion, starting with the top zone of the first 
reactor. Initial values of heater outputs could be conservatively entered (by stepwise increases in manual 
mode) based on experience from prior runs. When the external and internal temperatures of a zone were 
in reasonable proximity, the control loop could be turned to auto in “delta mode”, aiming for the external 
temperature to match the internal one. Since adding heat to the reactor system raises the internal 
temperature and promotes additional reaction and heat generation, the heater adjustments create what is 
likened to a “waterfall effect”, hence the need to proceed from top of the reactor downward. To some 
extent, the three reactors can be lined out in parallel, but since the line heaters in between reactors do not 
provide sufficient power to overcome all heat losses, meaningful line-out could only start when the 
preceding reactor had established a temperature rise large enough to bring the next reactor to the desired 
feed temperature. This phase of startup required careful attention and was done more slowly to avoid 
temperatures spiking higher than desired. Working only during daytime hours, full lineout could be 
established in about two days; further optimization based on operating experience would be possible. 

At several times during early operation, temperature spikes to as high as 600°C were observed when the 
combination of inlet temperature and feed flow/composition to a reactor would promote high conversion. 
Such temperatures were still within the limits of safe operation of the reactors, so generally did not cause

a full shutdown. Compared to experience reported from the STCG hydrogenolysis system piloting, 
runaway in the hydrocracking system appears to be more muted, with less tendency to spike high and less 
sensitivity to feed temperature changes. This was fortunate, because the temperature control in the SwRI 
preheater/reactor system was not nearly as tight as could be accomplished at STCG, temperatures 
fluctuating by +/- 1°C even during periods of good control, and more during upsets in flow control or 
other system components. The greater robustness against runaway can be attributed to a few factors: 

 Compared to hydrogenolysis, the hydrocracking reactors are operated at higher temperature, 
where the sensitivity of reactor rate to incremental temperature increases is smaller per the 
Arrhenius equation. This is also expressed in the Zeldovich number, which contains the square of 
the absolute temperature in the denominator; a high value of the Zeldovich number renders a 
process conducive to runaway. 

 Inherent energy buffering in the reaction network: as temperatures increase, endothermic 
dehydrogenation reactions become more favorable, including those that produce aromatics. 
Through the contribution of these reactions, the overall temperature rise is suppressed. 

 Higher heat loss in the reactor system: compared to the highly insulated STCG reactors, the SwRI 
reactors lose more heat at their respective process temperatures. While this heat loss is 
compensated for at steady state, during a sudden temperature increase the compensating heaters 
do not respond as quickly (and may be limited by their maximum output values), causing a net 
energy outflow and thereby suppressing the temperature rise below the adiabatic value. 

The first two factors, which are inherent to the reaction system, are probably more important than the 
third, but a detailed analysis has not been conducted. 

Once the system dynamics were appreciated, temperature excursions became much rarer. In the final, 
longest run, flow disruptions caused a few momentary spikes, with reactor exit temperatures briefly 
increasing by up to 40°C above their steady-state values, but overall the desired temperature profiles 
through the reactors were reliably maintained. 

Although inlet temperatures to the reactors were well controlled, the outlet temperatures underwent much 
greater fluctuations, as reported above; the example in Figure 2 displays a range of 492-510°C for the 
outlet temperature of the first reactor over the course of one day. These fluctuations are likely due to 
variability in feed flow and composition; regardless of their origin, their unknown dynamics make it quite 
challenging to attempt to control the outlet temperatures (as a proxy for conversion) of the reactors. 
Hence, this was not attempted, opting instead for steady reactor inlet temperatures and allowing the outlet 
temperatures to ride their cycle. 

Given this simple approach to overall system control, not much interaction with the reactor system was 
required during day-to-day steady operation, besides ensuring the availability of feeds and the reliability 
of supporting functions such as chillers, flare system, analytical, and heat tracing. During the final run, the 
unit was partially attended during working hours, and unattended during overnight hours and weekends 
Alarms were delivered by cell phone, and sometimes prompted operators to take action remotely. 

Data from the various instruments was compiled daily into an Excel spreadsheet and sent for inspection, 
along with the results from GC analysis. Processing of these daily files was automated using Excel 
macros, allowing for quick inspection of incremental results every business day.

GC analytical – online and condensate samples 
As noted before, two gas chromatographs were set up in service of this piloting effort. Both were older 
Varian instruments, configured as refinery gas analyzers to allow quantitation of a wide range of 
inorganic and organic compounds. Among the inorganics, only hydrogen and nitrogen were of practical 
importance; among organics, the primary components observed were methane, ethane, propane, isobutane 
and n-butane. Propylene and the butene isomers were also observed and individually quantified, as were 
pentane (isomer speciation suspect), benzene, toluene, and the xylenes. Other peaks were lumped into 
groups by estimated carbon count, although usually no compounds greater than C6 (besides toluene and 
xylenes) were seen in measurable quantities. 

The GC instruments were configured, calibrated, and maintained by an analytical team, separate from the 
core process operators. After initial calibration, calibration consistency was checked by periodically 
injecting several calibration gases onto both GCs (continuous calibration verification, CCV). While these 
were helpful at times to identify problems, they were not done frequently enough to allow recalibration or 
re-interpretation of flawed results; when questionable GC results were obtained, the analytical team was 
called on to adjust the method or manually re-integrate chromatograms. Perhaps because of the age of the 
equipment, its setup in a non-air-conditioned space, or inconsistency of sample flow, the quality and 
consistency of the GC data was somewhat less than would be expected from typical modern instruments. 
However, it was sufficient to determine selectivities and discern trends, and in any case, variability in the 
GC sample results is probably due more to actual fluctuations in process parameters than to imperfect GC 
analysis. 

It was originally envisioned that the two GCs would each cycle through the four sample points (feed, and 
effluents from the three reactors), to eliminate any instrument bias on trend results. However, because of 
complications with sample delivery and selection it was decided early on to use each of the GCs for 
dedicated samples. Since obtaining a steady feed composition proved to be more challenging than 
anticipated, the first GC was dedicated solely to feed shots, which can be completed using a shorter cycle 
time due to the absence of heavy components. The second GC alternated between the reactor effluents, in 
a pattern favoring the final effluent from the third reactor, since this is indicative of overall process 
performance. 

Two measures serve as primary quality checks on the GC analytical data: the total of compounds 
analyzed by GC (for all samples), and the fraction of isobutane among the butanes (in the feed sample): 
these should not be affected by any process fluctuations, and can be analyzed in isolation. The iso fraction 
could drift somewhat with time, as the lighter component distributes to a greater extent to the tanker 
headspace, but this should be a minor effect given the low inventory in the headspace. 

The progression of these two metrics during run 5 is shown in Figure 4. The iso fraction trend is 
interrupted (adjusted upward) at two points, as a result of GC recalibration, but follows an overall 
downward progression as if decaying towards a fixed value. This systematic trend, if it is indicative of 
shifting GC performance, is troubling, because it may mean that there is a systematic error in the GC 
analysis that is changing in magnitude with time.

Figure 4. Trends of the measured isobutane fraction among total butanes (expected value: 0.3) and the total of 
quantified GC components (expected value: 100%) during run 5.  

The GC total trend displays a distinct day/night cycle; during the second half of the run, its average value 
is fairly close to 100%. The cycle may be due to variation of the flow delivered by the liquid butane flow 
controller as density cycles with ambient temperature, combined with imperfect calibration of the GC. Or 
it may be related to variations in sample flow or pressure with ambient conditions. The fluctuations are 
not a cause of great concern, since their effects will average out over the course of a day, allowing longer-
term trends to emerge. Specific results from process sample analysis and their interpretation will be 
presented later in this report. 

The knockout pot downstream of the third reactor was designed to separate any liquids from the cooled 
effluent gas before sending the latter to flare. In practice, very little liquid accumulation was observed 
during normal operation – during run 5, an insufficient amount for analysis. Earlier in piloting, perhaps 
because of colder ambient temperatures, a little more condensate could be collected, from the reactor 
system knockout pot as well as a knockout pot in the line running to the flare. These liquids were 
analyzed by an offline GC in SwRI’s analytical department; results are shown below in terms of area% 
(which should correspond roughly to wt%).

The difference in composition between these samples is likely due to the colder condition at the (outside) 
flare knockout, causing some components that had not been condensed in the earlier knockout pot to drop 
out; they may have combined with some liquid that had condensed earlier at warmer conditions, resulting 
in a wider distribution of light and heavy compounds, compared to the heavy-weighted composition of 
the reactor system knockout. In any case, the component slate is qualitatively consistent with previous 
results reported by Heng Shou for a bench-scale hydrocracking reactor1. Given the very small rate of 
accumulation, the formation of these heavy compounds does not affect the system mass balance, although 
even small concentrations may be relevant to downstream operations, e.g. because of fouling/ gumming 
potential. 

Run 5 results 
The final run 5 had by far the longest onstream time in the overall piloting campaign, and also the longest 
stretch of operation uninterrupted by shutdowns or upsets. Therefore, this run will be subjected to the 
greatest scrutiny in this report. Full results from all longer runs are available on the project share drive 
(Y:\C4-C5 Utilization Program\SwRI) for further analysis if necessary. 

Run conditions 
The reactors were started up according to the protocol described above. The initial space velocity was 
about 3 kgbutane/kgcath, adjusted downward to 2.8 after several days of operation. Following startup, the 
operating conditions of the reactors were adjusted to obtain a suitably high ethane yield, as was required 
to compete with the higher-selectivity hydrogenolysis process. There is no a priori method to distribute 
conversion across the three reactors – unlike in the hydrogenolysis piloting effort, where conversion per 
reactor was limited by runaway concerns, the conversions across each of the reactors could be freely 
adjusted here, by manipulating the feed temperature to each of the reactors. The term “conversion” must 
be used somewhat loosely here, because the butanes in the feed are converted relatively readily to smaller 
molecules, leaving the more difficult conversion of propane for the downstream reactors. Without 
referring to exact measures of chemical conversion, the reactive duty of each of the reactors may be 
characterized by the temperature rise across the reactor. In multi-reactor predictive modeling performed 
using the hydrocracking kinetics developed in an earlier effort, a progression along the three reactors with 
increasing inlet and outlet temperatures had been proposed for the pilot reactors. However, this approach

was adjusted somewhat in light of observations made early in the run. When temperatures were pushed 
high enough to obtain the desired yield of ethane, the methane yield was higher than expected. Since 
methane make is a strong function of temperature, it was decided to run each of the reactors with the same 
outlet temperature, to avoid a particularly high temperature in any one of the reactors. At the space 
velocity applied, the outlet temperature producing a sufficient yield of ethane was around 520°C. 
Therefore, inlet temperatures were established to produce roughly this outlet temperature in each of the 
reactors: 395°C in the first reactor, 418°C in the second reactor, and 440°C in the third reactor. This 
means that the first reactor, despite having far less catalyst and hence a higher space velocity than the 
others, achieves the highest amount of reaction, and the last, largest reactor, the smallest amount. This is 
not entirely surprising: the easy hydrocracking of butanes is mostly completed in the first reactor, while 
more difficult conversion of propane takes place partly in the second reactor and mostly in the third. 

The space velocity established early on in the run was 2.8 kg butane/kgcath. In light of the high methane 
make, it was reduced to 2.5 kg butane/kgcath about 10 days into the run, in the hope that it would be 
possible to lower the reactor temperatures to achieve the same ethane yield. Even though temperatures 
could indeed be reduced somewhat, the methane make did not meaningfully change. On May 16, the 
reactor system shut down due to an instrument failure, and was restarted the following day, at a further 
lowered space velocity of 2.3 kg butane/kgcath. In the interest of maintaining steady reaction conditions 
for the maximum onstream time, it was decided to retain these, admittedly not optimized, reaction 
conditions for the remainder of the run. 

The same pressure, 100 psig at the outlet of the final reactor, was maintained throughout the run. 

Feed composition 
The aim throughout the piloting campaign, including in run 5, was to operate with an equimolar mixture 
of butanes and hydrogen. However, due to the characteristics of the flow controllers, this composition was 
not exactly maintained throughout the run. 

The butanes stream was delivered by an Alicat liquid flow controller, operating on a principle of pressure 
drop measurement through a laminar flow stack. Two controllers were used in the project; both had been 
factory-calibrated for the butanes mixture, but obtaining accurate and reliable performance proved to be 
elusive. Controllers were swapped out on several occasions, including once during an outage in run 5 in 
an attempt to resolve noisy control performance. However, variability remained greater than expected 
based on product specifications. The variability was not just signal/measurement variability from the 
controller’s sensing element: the redundant Coriolis mass flow meter just upstream of the flow controller 
had a similarly noisy signal, suggesting that the flow variations were real.  

The variability of flow had an important impact on controller operation. Since the butanes were dosed by 
liquid volumetric flow, the readout must be multiplied by density to obtain mass flow; the system being 
operated in a non-air-conditioned space, temperature and density fluctuations were not negligible, so the 
measured temperature of the butane feed was used in daily data processing to calculate the mass flow. 
This meant that the butanes mass flow varied on a day/night cycle. Had flow been relatively steady, the 
setpoint of the controller could have been adjusted based on the reading of the Coriolis meter, but the 
signal was too noisy to implement this. The alternative of using butane temperature to adjust the liquid 
flow setpoint was considered but could not be implemented in a timely fashion. Therefore, a slight 
variability (+/- 1.5%) of butanes mass flow, in a daily cycle pattern, is a consistent feature of the run.

Figure 5. Trends during run 5 of feed concentrations measured by GC, along with related flowmeter measurements. 

The two hydrogen mass flow controllers were also somewhat noisy, but their performance appeared to be 
steady. In combination, the butane and hydrogen flow controls should therefore have resulted in a feed 
composition with slight variation around the 50% mark. Figure 5 shows the actual progression of GC 
analytical for the feed composition. In the first half of the run, mass flow controller issues resulted in 
considerable deviation from the 50% hydrogen level. After swapping out the flow controller around May 
17, better conformance to the desired level was observed. From that point, the setpoints of the three mass 
flow controllers were maintained at identical values; the slight upward drift of the hydrogen concentration 
in the final weeks of the run is likely due to drift in the GC calibration: drift in the butane flow controller 
would have manifested itself in the redundant Coriolis meter (FT903 in the plot), which in fact remained 
steady through this episode; and gas mass flow controllers are generally not subject to drift, although this 
cannot be ruled out. 

The feed composition will be further scrutinized in the section on mass balance below. 

Product distributions 
Trends of product distributions from the three reactors, along with their inlet and outlet temperatures, are 
qualitatively summarized below; they will be analyzed in more detail in subsequent sections of this report. 
The ethane selectivities plotted in the graphs below are molar carbon selectivities, which are

Figure 6. Composition trends of the effluent from the first reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet 
temperatures. 

Figure 6 shows the trends for the first reactor. Due to GC configuration problems, data is missing through 
the middle part of the run, after restart following flow controller replacement. As noted before, the results 
in the first half of the run were affected by unsteady feed control. One point to note about this early phase 
of the run is the decrease in space velocity around May 7, accompanied by a slight reduction in feed 
temperature (from 400°C to 395°C).  In this reactor, the effects of these changes are largely positive: the 
ethane selectivity remained about the same, while the methane concentration in the effluent decreased; 
these effects are obvious even in the context of rather noisy overall trends, and significant swings in the 
hydrogen concentration. 

The results for the final few weeks show a steady conversion of the butanes, at a high but incomplete 
level (75-80% overall conversion). The predominant product is propane at ~25%, with ethane at ~14% 
and methane at ~7%. The variability of the hydrogen measurements is striking. This cannot be (entirely) 
attributed to GC analytical issues, because the total of the GC concentrations (not shown in the plot) 
exhibits a smaller degree of fluctuation. Hence, there appears to be a real variation of hydrogen, with 
hydrogen concentration going high when ethane/butane go low and vice versa. Variations are much larger 
than those seen in the feed composition (see section above), so they can also not be (entirely) attributed to 
feed composition fluctuations. The only other plausible source of fluctuation is variability in the rates of 
reaction occurring across the catalyst, or in the total flow passing through the reactor. Neither can be 
readily explained, but must be considered in more in-depth analysis of the results. The concentrations of 
aromatics in this stream are too small to be plotted (total <0.1%); apparently aromatics are not readily 
formed, even at relatively high temperature, when the hydrogen concentration is still high. Pentane is also 
observed at a low level (0.2-0.3%).

Figure 7. Composition trends of the effluent from the second reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet 
temperatures. 

Figure 7 shows the trends for the second reactor. Most of the butanes remaining after the first reactor are 
now converted (~96% conversion), and the process of converting propane to ethane is well underway. As 
was the case for the first reactor, the initial weeks of operation show noisier results – but over the course 
of passing through two reactors, the swings have become more muted, making the results more conducive 
to interpretation. The downward change in space velocity on May 7 is here seen to be neutral: ethane 
selectivity remains close to its previous value, and the beneficial effect on methane concentration evident 
in the first-reactor results is no longer observed, which means that relative rate of methane production vs. 
ethane production through the second reactor must have actually increased. The cause for this is not clear, 
since temperature levels were slightly lowered around the time the space velocity was decreased. 

Focusing on the final weeks of operation, we see relatively steady performance. Hydrogen concentration 
in the effluent is still noisy, but the variability is lower than that of the first reactor. Ethane concentrations 
are also fairly noisy, but the calculated ethane selectivity shows less variability (44-46%); this is 
consistent with the notion that hydrogen and hydrocarbon concentrations swing in opposite directions, as 
discussed above. Methane is now a prominent product, almost as abundant as propane in the effluent. 
Aromatics production has increased, with total BTX concentration reaching around 0.25% (1.2% carbon 
selectivity), while pentane is no longer present in appreciable concentration.

Figure 8. Composition trends of the effluent from the third reactor during run 5, along with inlet and outlet 
temperatures. 

Figure 8 shows the trends for the third reactor. Compared to the second reactor, butanes conversion has 
increased, but is still incomplete (98%). Both ethane and methane have increased in concentration, at the 
expense of propane, but the additional conversion is limited. Ethane selectivity increased to 52-53%, with 
further decreased noise in the calculated value. Aromatics selectivity shows a slight uptick, to 1.4%. The 
net effect of this third reactor is small compared to the first and second reactors, which appears to be 
inconsistent with the observed temperature rise, which is intermediate between the rises seen in the first 
and second reactors. This will be further explored below. 

Catalyst stability 
Looking at the composition trends in the final weeks of operation (06-Figure 8), no clear progression 
towards lower conversion or selectivity can be discerned. The trends display some gentle multi-day 
swings, but these move in both directions; the final product (reactor 3 effluent) appears to be especially 
steady, with hardly any movement in ethane yield over the course of three weeks. 

The relative stability at the end of the campaign might be attributed to the fact that the fraction of active 
sites that had especially high activity and were most prone to deactivation had already declined in activity 
before the onset of this episode of steady operation (indeed, at the beginning of the full run). The majority 
of the catalyst had been in place since February, and had seen multiple startups and runs of a combined 
duration of 32 days before run 5 was started. 

In extended life testing in bench-scale reactors, Heng Shou demonstrated hydrocracking catalyst 
performance over several months onstream. In these experiments, conducted at conditions similar to those 
at SwRI (WHSV=2 hr-1, H2:HC=1, P=100 psig) overall ethane yield could be maintained, but this

required gradual increases in the imposed reactor temperature throughout the run – even after a few 
months onstream – from around 435°C to >500°C. The observed lack of continued deactivation in the 
pilot trials appears to contrast with this previous study, so it is worthwhile exploring differences between 
the studies.  

The bench-scale reactor experiments were conducted in a mostly isothermal fashion – some temperature 
increase was observed near the front end of the bed, but this was much smaller than the adiabatic 
temperature rise. Also, in the smaller reactors, the entire conversion was accomplished in a single reactor, 
rather than in a sequence of three reactors. In an adiabatic reactor conducting an exothermic reaction, a 
small change in catalyst activity may be magnified because of the self-accelerating nature of the reaction 
kinetics. From this point of view, we would expect adiabatic reactors whose feed temperature is 
maintained constant to be more, not less, sensitive to deactivation. On the other hand, it is possible that 
some aspects of the reaction kinetics are self-limiting as temperatures increase, perhaps because of an 
equilibrium condition arising within the reaction network; in this case, the adiabatic reactor will tend to 
produce similar results even as the catalyst activity changes. This is conjecture – the mechanisms 
considered in kinetic modeling do not provide for such a self-limiting temperature effect. 

Comparing the SwRI reactors to the bench reactor, a similar overall space velocity was maintained in a 
much longer total catalyst bed length (4 m vs. 10 cm), resulting in much higher linear velocities (90 cm/s 
in SwRI reactor 1, vs. 6 mm/s at bench scale), which in turn give rise to higher heat and mass transfer 
coefficients (gas-to-catalyst and gas-to-wall), and less propensity for axial dispersion of heat and mass. 
However, even at the bench scale the velocity is high enough to minimize the effect of axial dispersion 
(Pe of the order of 50), so the latter effect should not be important. The possibility of external mass 
transfer limitations between bulk gas and catalyst was evaluated for lab-scale reactors (with similar or 
even smaller bed lengths), and found not to be significant. So although there is quite a difference in 
operating conditions at the two scales, both should conform to pseudo-homogeneous plug flow reactor 
behavior; there is no obvious reason why one set of conditions should promote more rapid deactivation 
than the other. 

The feeds to the bench scale reactor and the SwRI units were both 70/30 normal/iso with nominal 99.5+% 
purity; while detailed impurity profiles are not available, it seems unlikely that the feed quality was a 
significant differentiating factor between the experimental results, especially since the primary 
deactivation mechanism is believed to be deposition of coke produced from precursors formed in the 
reaction network, rather than poisoning by feed components.

Reactor unloading and catalyst characterization 
Following a controlled shutdown of the reactor system at the end of run 5, the catalyst was unloaded from 
each of the reactors, using a vacuum to extract the catalyst layer-wise from the top. The loading details 
were used to determine the layer depths, in an attempt to collect separately the top and bottom inert layers 
and three catalyst fractions of approximately equal size, for further analysis. It was not possible to 
perfectly segregate inert from catalyst in this procedure (see Figure 9); each of they layers was visually 
inspected and photographed, weighed to infer mass gain/loss, and samples retained for analysis. Since the 
inert material is much denser than the catalyst, even a small volume fraction may translate to a larger 
weight fraction.  

This makes it difficult to compare the loaded weights to the extracted weights for individual layers; the 
comparison of total weight (inert plus catalyst) is more meaningful. The table below shows the results of 
unloading, along with the initial weights loaded.

The sample weights indicate a net increase in weight of the materials in all three reactors: 77 g, 196 g, and 
107 g, respectively. The most likely source of the extra weight is deposition of coke, which is consistent 
with the observed color of the extracted materials: some of the inert particles were a darker gray than the 
fresh material, and the catalyst particles had turned from white to dark gray (top layer) or black (bottom 
layer), as shown in the photos of Figure 10. 

Each of the samples (except for the top inert layer in R101, which appears to have been overlooked) was 
subjected to carbon/hydrogen/nitrogen elemental analysis at SwRI using ASTM method D5291. Only 
carbon was found in sufficient concentration to report; the analytical results, in terms of wt% carbon 
based on total mass of sample, are included in the table above, along with the calculated carbon weights. 
Very little coke was found on the inert material, with higher accumulations on the catalyst. The sum of 
these weights for each of the reactors is in the same ballpark as the total weight pickup, but the mass 
balance isn’t particularly good, and deviates downward in R301 and R101, upward in R201. This may be 
attributed to measurement errors during both loading and unloading, as well as uncertainty in the 
analytical results (each sample was analyzed in duplicate, with 1-24% difference between the analyses). It 
is also possible that some weight was lost due to crushing or erosion of the catalyst particles, but no 
evidence of significant fines accumulation downstream (e.g., on filter upstream of pressure control valve) 
was observed.  

The coke accumulation results are similar to those reported by Heng Shou from bench reactor results after 
one month onstream2, both in terms of absolute accumulations and the progression of coke deposition 
with length along reactor. This was not necessarily expected: the bench reactors operated fairly 
isothermally, with a maximum temperature attained in the top half of the catalyst bed, while the pilot 
reactors showed a continuous progression towards higher temperatures along the reactor. From the bench 
reactor results, we might have expected that degree of conversion (which determines hydrogen 
concentration) was the primary correlating factor for coke deposition rate. However, in the pilot reactors 
the coke deposition was consistently low near the front ends of the reactors, even though the conversion

level was much higher in the third reactor than in the first – so temperature appears to play a more 
important role than conversion. 

It is impossible to say whether coke deposition occurred gradually across the time onstream of the 
catalyst, or occurred predominantly in the early stages of the catalyst’s exposure to process conditions. 
The relative stability of catalyst performance with time toward the end of the run suggests that any 
continued coke laydown had at most a minor incremental effect on catalytic reaction rates. 

When related to the process feed rates, the accumulation of coke is insignificant: the total weight gain for 
all three reactors, averaged across the duration of the run, amounts to 0.35 g/h, compared to 8-10 kg/h 
butane feed. Hence, when evaluating mass balance (see below), the effect of coke deposition can be 
ignored. 

Mass balance 
The consistency of the run data can be assessed using various mass balance approaches. The simplest one 
is based on total flows as measured by the two Coriolis flowmeters and the two hydrogen mass flow 
controllers: the mass balance may be expressed as the ratio of the effluent Coriolis flow divided by the 
sum of the inlet flows (on a mass basis). The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 11.  

The calculations suggest that, after initial flow issues were resolved, the mass balance was reasonably 
well satisfied, especially during the middle part of the run; the source of the sudden decrease in measured 
outlet flow around June 6, causing a negative deviation from mass balance, is not understood, but is 
unlikely to be due to sudden onset of excessive coking or other phenomena that would physically prevent 
material entering the system from being measured in the outlet. During the preceding period, there is a

pronounced day/night cycle to the mass balance, arising from a corresponding cycle in the outlet flow 
data. Since Coriolis instruments are true mass flow meters, this cannot be readily explained by 
temperature correction effects. Taking the average of the cycles, there is a positive deviation from mass 
balance through this period of 1.5%, which is within the range of instrument error. Hence, the outlet flow 
is in reasonable agreement with the inlet flow, which should hold not only for the overall mass, but also 
for the individual elements. This observation will be used in evaluating the elemental mass balances 
below. 

The nitrogen entering with the butane is observed in GC analysis of feed and effluent samples, as 
previously discussed in the section on butane delivery. The trends are plotted in Figure 12. 

The concentration measured in the feed is consistently higher than the ones measured in the reactor 
effluents (which among themselves are quite consistent), by a factor of about 1.4. For elemental nitrogen 
balance to hold, the volumetric outlet flow would therefore need to be about 40% higher than the inlet 
flow. Some volume expansion is expected, because the formation of unsaturated compounds (olefins and 
aromatics) results in an increase in the number of moles, according to: 

𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 =

However, based on the outlet composition from reactor 3, this expansion factor should be less than 1.02. 
Therefore, the difference in measured outlet concentrations must be due to GC error; this is not 
unreasonable since the feed composition is measured on one GC while effluent compositions are

measured on the other, and calibration for nitrogen, a minor inert species, was probably not as rigorous as 
for the reactant and product species. Unfortunately, this means that nitrogen cannot be used as an internal 
standard in mass balance calculations. 

The other elements present are hydrogen and carbon. It is instructive to look at the ratio between these 
elements, since this should not change as long as everything entering the reactor exits, and also 
compensates for effects of sample pressure or flow that affect all species proportionally. This analysis is 
shown in Figure 13. 

An equimolar mixture of hydrogen and butane has an H/C ratio of 3, and indeed throughout the run the 
feed composition evaluated to a ratio not too far from this value, with day/night variations as mentioned 
before. The ratio in all three of the effluent samples is significantly higher, by about 7%. The three 
effluent compositions are among themselves fairly consistent in H/C, and show the same qualitative 
trends as the feed sample does, albeit with greater amplitude of the variations. One possible explanation 
for the difference in H/C values is that carbon is lost from the reaction mixture by coking. However, the 
amount of carbon deposition required to explain the difference is large, and inconsistent with the 
reasonable overall mass balance demonstrated above as well as the small measured coke deposition 
relative to feed flows. Furthermore, we would expect to see a progressively larger deviation of the H/C 
ratio through the reactors, as more carbon is laid down in each – but this is not observed in Figure 13. 
Similar objections apply to the hypothesis that heavies in the reactor effluent samples (relatively rich in 
carbon) are not analyzed by the GC (either because they condense before reaching the GC or because they 
don’t elute from the column): very little condensate is observed in the knockout pot, and the

concentrations of removed heavies (not pure carbon) required to explain the elemental imbalance are 
quite large. 

It appeared likely, then, that GC analysis was again to blame for the lack of mass balance. In this case, 
however, we were justified in having greater confidence in the accuracy of the GC results, since the 
components most strongly affecting the ratio are the primary feeds and products of the process, and 
therefore well covered by the calibration procedures. When the discrepancy was noticed as the run was 
proceeding, additional calibrations and checks were carried out to identify the source of the issue – but the 
analytical results on calibration standards were rather consistent. It is difficult to envision a way in which 
the analytical method for the second GC could be off while producing consistent results among the three 
effluent samples – hydrogen, which tends to be the most variable component and which strongly 
influences the H/C ratio, is quite different in the effluent of the first reactor vs. that of the third. The more 
likely culprit is the first GC: it only analyzes the feed composition, which remains relatively constant 
throughout the run. A persistent error in the results from this GC could most easily explain the H/C 
imbalance. Alternatively, the sample analyzed by the GC, drawn from the process not very far 
downstream of the hydrogen/butane mixing point, may not represent the fully mixed composition; 
because of the particular hydrodynamics a somewhat consistent error may result.  

Assigning the mass balance issue to problems with feed analysis is also somewhat consistent with the 
H/C ratio derived from the butane feed Coriolis meter and the two hydrogen mass flow controllers, also 
plotted in Figure 13. The trend is quantitatively closest to the trends derived from the second GC for most 
of the run, although none of the GC-derived trends align closely with the flowmeter-derived trend during 
the final weeks of operation. 

The balance of the evidence supports the assumption that the GC feed composition is the least reliable of 
the measurements, even if no direct evidence from calibration and troubleshooting could be found. Hence, 
in subsequent analysis, the feed composition will be derived from the product composition by mass 
balance, rather than taken from the feed GC results. Practically, this means that we assign a 
hydrogen/butane feed ratio of 1.05-1.1. 

Heat balance 
The aim of the pilot reactor operation is to simulate adiabatic operation by compensating heat loss to the 
environment with localized heat input from reactor zone heaters. The operating and control mode to 
accomplish this was described in a previous section. The effectiveness of implementation can be checked 
after the fact using measured inlet and outlet compositions and temperatures, by straightforward 
thermodynamic calculations. This was done for the conditions prevailing during the final weeks of the 
run, with steady performance; the procedure and results are reported here. 

First, the compositions of the effluents from the three reactors were averaged over the eight-day interval 
from June 4-11, and normalized on a nitrogen-free basis (nitrogen at 0.5 vol% would not meaningfully 
change calculated outlet temperatures). The H/C ratios for all three averaged effluent compositions were 
quite similar (3.243, 3.240, 3.246), which means the mass balances across the second and third reactors 
could be made to close almost exactly. As discussed above, the H/C ratio for the feed samples was much 
lower, so the feed to the first reactor was instead calculated based on the H/C ratio, to force closure of the 
elemental mass balances.

This provided inlet and outlet compositions for each of the reactors. A set of eight stoichiometric 
reactions were defined to allow interconversion between the ten species considered (H2, C1-C5 aliphatics, 
propylene, butenes, and toluene), where toluene was used to lump all BTX species, and isomers were 
lumped except for n-butane and isobutane. Through a straightforward Excel goal seek process, the extents 
of each of these reactions were determined that most closely reproduced the conversion from given inlet 
composition to given outlet composition. These reaction extents, along with inlet composition and 
temperature, were then used in an Aspen Plus simulation with a single RSTOIC reactor to calculate the 
temperature of the outlet stream. The calculated temperatures can then be compared to the measured 
catalyst bed outlet temperatures, evaluated from the point in each of the multipoint thermocouples that is 
in the inert layer below the catalyst but still within the heated zone of the reactor. The results for the three 
reactors are as follows: 

Reactor Measured Tin Measured Tout Calculated Tout Tmeas/Tcalc net heat (kJ/kg) 
1 395 512 490 1.22 75.0 
2 440 529 539 0.90 -45.9 
3 419 539 451 3.73 326 

 

The deviation from adiabatic performance is appreciable for the first two reactors, but is particularly 
striking for the third reactor. This was evident throughout the run; in fact the external temperatures for the 
bottom three reactor zones were maintained below the corresponding internal temperatures to partly offset 
the obvious thermal imbalance. Even with this attempt at correction, the temperature rise across the third 
reactor was far greater than can be explained by the heat of reaction.  

Figure 14 shows temperature profiles measured along the multi-point internal themocouples for each of 
the reactors during the period of stable operation toward the end of the run. The horizontal scale is the 
length along the catalyst bed (top of bed at zero); the extents of the active catalyst zones in each of the 
reactors are indicated by the dashed vertical lines. This plot confirms that reactors 1 and 2 adhere better to 
the adiabatic ideal than reactor 3: their profiles upstream and downstream of the catalyst zone are 
relatively flat, taking the majority of the overall temperature increase across just the catalyst bed. In 
reactor 3, on the other hand, the temperature rises by 50°C even before the top of the catalyst bed; the 
bottom end of the reactor is better behaved, with only a slight additional rise after the active layer.

Figure 14. Measured internal reactor temperatures profiles on June 12th, 12:00am. 

It appears likely that the thermocouples used in the adiabatic temperature control scheme for reactor 3 had 
a systematic error: if either the external thermocouples read too low, or the internal ones read too high, the 
heater controls would be driven to produce a situation where the external temperatures exceeded the 
internals ones, leading to a net heat input into the reactor and therefore super-adiabatic behavior. 
However, it is not obvious why such a systematic error should exist: the internal multipoint thermocouple 
was purchased and installed at the same time as those for the other two reactors (in late 2018), while 
several of the external thermocouples were replaced during overhauls of the reactor heaters at various 
points during the piloting trials. The process temperature measured downstream of the third reactor (TE-
208) averaged 519°C, about 30°C below the measured catalyst bed temperature (which is consistent with 
heat loss observed downstream of the first reactor) and well above the calculated outlet temperature – so 
the discrepancy certainly cannot be attributed solely to internal temperature measurement. 

 The most likely explanation is that the external thermocouples, despite being springloaded to contact the 
reactor wall, were placed such that they did not measure the hottest wall temperatures due to the relative 
layout of the reactor heaters, reactor, and thermocouples. The third reactor is different from the other two 
in that the heaters are metallic with quite different dynamics (slower) and likely different effectiveness of 
heat transfer than the ceramic heaters. 

The exact cause for the net heat influx may never be known with confidence; in any case, it is clear that 
the results from the third reactor must be interpreted in the light of quite non-adiabatic thermal 
performance. Even the deviations of the first two reactors are large enough to require some adjustment in 
further analysis relative to the simple adiabatic assumption. In modeling efforts, net heat will need to be 
added or subtracted from the process gas to match the observed outlet temperature; this heat can be found 
using a variation of the Aspen simulation described above, and is included in the table above.

kgbutane/kgcath, H2:HC=1, and reactor inlet temperatures of 450°C, 465°C, and 480°C. 

Comparison against reactor model 
A reaction network and kinetic model had been developed based on extensive laboratory testing data 
before the pilot campaign was conducted. A straightforward reactor model (sequence of adiabatic plug 
flow reactors) was constructed in MATLAB, and used to define the process conditions expected to 
produce favorable results in the pilot plant: high conversion and >55% ethane yield while avoiding overly 
high temperatures in any of the reactors. At a space velocity of 4 kgbutane/kgcath, suggested reactor inlet 
temperatures were 450°C, 465°C, and 480°C. The predicted profiles for this case are shown in Figure 15. 

The kinetic model had been developed using the original formulation of bifunctional catalyst 
(corresponding to Zeolyst product code ZD15015A from catalyst table above, with SAR=50); for the 
majority of the runs in the campaign, including run 5, the newer formulation (SAR=30, product code 
ZD18029) was used, which in laboratory testing had shown better performance, especially characterized 
by higher reaction rates at low temperature, as exemplified by results in table below.

Figure 16. Composition and temperature profiles predicted by MATLAB through the three-reactor pilot system for 
inlet conditions corresponding to final weeks of pilot run 5. 

To compare pilot trial results with predictions from the reactor model, the non-adiabatic performance of 
the reactors must be taken into account. The previous section quantified the net heat applied to the process 
gas by the reactor heaters based on thermodynamic calculations. The heat balance in the MATLAB 
reactor model was extended to include a heat input term, which is distributed uniformly across the length 
of the reactor. For positive net heat (reactors 1 and 3), this term will not only result in a direct increase in 
the predicted reactor outlet temperature, but also an indirect increase due to the higher rate of reaction; the 
opposite holds for reactor 2, with negative net heat. 

When the feed composition and space velocity, reactor inlet temperatures, and net heat flows for the 
SwRI reactor system (taken from steady performance during final weeks of run 5) are used as inputs to 
the MATLAB model, the profiles shown in Figure 16 are obtained. 

These profiles do not resemble the ones observed during the actual pilot trial: overall conversion and 
ethane yield are greatly underpredicted, mostly because the model predicts very low reaction rates at the 
395°C inlet temperature to the first reactor; the modeled temperature rise through this reactor is almost 
entirely due to the applied net heat. Conversions and temperature rises through the subsequent reactors are 
higher, but even here, rates are underpredicted: unlike in the pilot runs, modeled reactor exit temperatures 
remain well below 500°C.  

One of the reasons for the discrepancy between model and experimental results is the different catalyst 
used. The newer catalyst variant was selected partly for its higher activity, which is especially apparent in 
the low temperature range. However, this cannot fully explain the difference. In this context, experimental 
results were examined that had been obtained in laboratory reactors under non-differential conditions over 
a wide range of temperatures (375-475°C). These experiments were not part of the data set used for

kinetic model development, but are relevant because they probe to lower temperatures than were studied 
in the kinetics experiments. Experiments at identical conditions were conducted for the original SAR-50 
catalyst and the new SAR-30 catalyst. The experimental hydrocarbon conversion results are plotted in 
Figure 17, along with model predictions. The model clearly underpredicts the results for both catalysts at 
low temperature, while providing reasonable predictions at temperatures above 450°C. The same trends 
(deviation at low temperature, reasonable fit at high temperature) hold for other variables besides 
conversion. 

The experimental results suggest a much lower effective activation energy than is implicit in the model. 
The temperature dependence of the model is complex: the activation energy of the primary butane 
conversion pathways, which proceed via butene intermediates, is very low, but the rates rise quickly with 
temperature because the dehydrogenation equilibrium is governed by its endothermic heat of reaction. At 
low temperatures, very low concentrations of olefins are present, leading to a low rate of the main 
reaction step (which is second order in butene concentration). 

Therefore, adjusting the kinetic model to account for the higher activity at low temperature will require 
more than a straightforward adjustment of one or more activation energies. Reaction orders and perhaps 
the reaction network itself may need to be modified to allow accurate representation of kinetics across the 
entire temperature range of interest. The integral experiments discussed above would be a useful input 
into such an extension of the kinetic modeling, but it is likely that additional data at more differential 
reaction conditions would be required to validate and support the updated model. The costs of such an 
effort would need to be balanced against the perceived need for an accurate hydrocracking reactor model. 
For back-of-the-envelope calculations, a detailed model is likely not required; the model could likely be 
adjusted to accurately predict a subset of integral conversion results near anticipated operating conditions 
(including the low-temperature results above), even if its predictive ability would be poor for conditions

further away from the likely operating points. Of course this would still apply only to the SAR-50 catalyst 
– not enough data is available for the SAR-30 catalyst to build even a moderately predictive model. 

Conclusions 
Butane hydrocracking over Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst was demonstrated in a configuration of three reactors in 
series, operated in simulated adiabatic mode. After considerable performance and reliability issues with 
the the originally designed apparatus were addressed by equipment redesign, several extended-length runs 
were conducted; four runs, totaling 77 days on stream, were conducted using the final catalyst loading of 
the improved SAR-30 catalyst formulation.  

Through commissioning activities and extended runs, the hydrocracking catalyst system was found to be 
robust and resilient. It was much less sensitive to runaway than the hydrogenolysis catalyst system, with 
temperature rises across reactors of 100°C maintained without excessive variability. 

The final run, lasting 45 days, was carried out at relatively constant operating conditions (space velocity 
2.3 h-1, hydrogen/butane molar ratio=1, 100 psig, reactor inlet temperatures selected to produce ~520°C 
outlet temperatures), with especially steady operation during the final weeks. An overall ethane carbon 
yield about 52% was maintained. No progressive catalyst deactivation was observed during this interval, 
although coke accumulations of 3-16 wt% were observed in post-run catalyst analysis. 

The simulated adiabatic operating mode was moderately successful for the first two reactors, while the 
third reactor experienced a much higher temperature rise than would be expected at adiabatic operation. 
This is attributed to problems measuring heater/wall temperatures in this reactor.  

The measured conversions, especially in the first reactor, were found to be much higher than values 
predicted using the previously developed kinetics and reactor model, mostly due to higher activity at low 
temperature. This is only partly attributed to the newer, more active catalyst used in the pilot runs. More 
low-temperature data would need to be acquired to adjust the hydrocracking kinetic model for better 
predictive power across the entire temperature range.

Title: Deactivation modeling of an Ir-Pt catalyst in butane hydrogenolysis reaction 

Project: Butane to Ethane (Accolade # 116955) 

Authors†: Heng Shou, Ashwin Patel, Cong Nguyen, and Byeongjin Baek 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The deactivation of the butane hydrogenolysis catalyst was modeled using a Langmuir-

Hinshelwood expression. It is among the first efforts to model reaction-induced catalyst deactivation via 

reasonably hypothesized surface reactions. More importantly, it is the first discovery on a counter-intuitive 

phenomenon, in which precious metal catalyst can be more stable in hydrogen-lean conditions than 

hydrogen-rich ones in hydrocarbon processing. Despite the counter-intuition, such a phenomenon is 

consistent with the projection by the deactivation model. 

When comparing to the previously used benchmark testing conditions, the hydrogen-lean 

conditions can significantly extend the catalyst lifetime at a higher rate of reaction. The learnings from 

the model can substantially shorten reactor downtime, shrink the reactor size to achieve the same 

production rate, and reduce the cost of separating excessive H2.

1 Introduction 
The definition of a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction and 

cyclically turns over to its original state as the reaction completes. The implied situation is that the catalyst 

remains unchanged during this process. However, in all catalytic reactions, catalyst deactivation is as 

certain as death and taxes. Figure 1 shows the deactivation time for some processes. The time scale of 

deactivation has profound consequences for process design. The environmental catalysts for 

automobiles are required to last as long as the vehicle’s lifetime mileage. The processes with long catalyst 

lifetime (months to years) suit well in fixed-bed reactors. Those with shorter lifetime require slurry or 

moving-bed reactors. A process like FCC, where the zeolite catalyst can merely last for seconds, needs 

a catalyst regenerator that is larger than the reactor. 

 
Figure 1. The time scale of deactivation of various catalytic processes.1 FCC: fluid catalytic cracking, 
HDS: hydrodesulfurization, EO: ethylene oxide, MA: Maleic anhydride, SCR: selective catalytic reduction, 
TWC: three-way converter. 

Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the deactivation phenomena inside a catalyst 

particle. Attrition is directly related to the structural integrity of the catalyst substrates, which is under 

rigorous tests when the catalyst particles are in motion; attrition hence especially applies to moving-bed, 

fluid-bed, and slurry-bed reactors. Sintering refers to the process of catalyst particles agglomerating, 

which requires high enough temperature to mobilize them. Deactivation also occurs when the catalyst 

reacts with a reactant to form a volatile species in a gas-phase reaction or a soluble species in a liquid-

phase reaction (leaching), such as anchored Suzuki catalysts for cross coupling2. Poisoning is often 

caused by impurities in the feed; example poisons are arsenic and sulfur on a CoMo hydrotreating 

catalyst supported on alumina or faujasite, where arsenic poisons both the metal and the substrate and 

sulfur poisoning mostly applies to the metals. Fouling is caused by reactions promoted by the catalyst 

itself; in this process, strongly adsorbed species are formed, which render their adsorption sites inactive. 

The cause of catalyst deactivation is highly specific to the application; we will consider here the 

deactivation phenomena during hydrogenolysis of alkanes. It is generally regarded as mono-functional 

chemistry occurring on metals. Iglesia and co-workers detailed the micro-kinetics of the process2-7. As is 

shown in Figure 3, as the linear alkane undergoes multiple dehydrogenation steps, two adjacent carbon

atoms are co-adsorbed on the metal surface; this establishes the conditions for C–C bond cleavage. 

Finally, the highly dehydrogenated fragments on the metal surface react with H2 to desorb and form 

shorter alkanes. 

 
Figure 2. Major types of deactivation in heterogeneous catalysis1 

 
Figure 3. Schematic pathway of surface reactions of butane hydrogenolysis to ethane. R1 of R2 refers to 
either an alkyl group or a hydrogen.  

Given that the butane hydrogenolysis reaction on the Ir-Pt catalyst was conducted at moderate 

conditions (520-600 K, 4.5-11.4 bar) in a reducing environment, the metal clusters on the substrate 

should have limited mobility and volatility. The reaction was carried in fixed-bed reactors, so the structural 

integrity of the catalyst substrate is of minor concern. The feed has negligible impurities, especially the 

non-hydrocarbon ones, so the catalyst ought to have limited exposure to poisons. Therefore, it appears 

likely that catalyst deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is due to fouling, caused by surface deposits 

formed during the reaction. It is consistent with the reaction mechanism of alkane hydrogenolysis 

presented in Figure 3, during which highly dehydrogenated surface intermediates are formed. 

This study is based on the premise that the deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is mainly from 

fouling. Preliminary observations suggested that the deactivation could be described by Langmuir-

Hinshelwood (LH) type kinetics, and a deactivation model was developed accordingly using an approach 

similar to primary reaction kinetics based on reasonably hypothesized and simplified surface reactions. 

The presented work is among the first efforts to model catalyst deactivation using an LH rate expression. 

The findings herein suggest that elevating hydrogen partial pressure or lowering hydrocarbon 

partial pressure is not always the most effective means of mitigating catalyst deactivation. In fact, catalyst 

lifetime could be significantly extended when hydrogen was relatively lean, even slightly below reaction 

stoichiometry, which is unprecedented in literature reports. Besides, the Furthermore, the hydrogen-lean 

conditions coincide with a faster reaction rate, which implies that the same production capacity may be 

achieved with a smaller reactor size.

2 Methods 

2.1 Catalyst  

According to a previous report8, the following recipe was transferred to Zeolyst for scaling up. An 

aqueous solution was made by dissolving 0.042 g of H2IrCl6·6H2O (Aldrich) in 3.0 mL D.I. water. Similarly, 

an aqueous solution was made by dissolving 0.042 g of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich) in 1.0 mL of D.I. water. 

The two solutions were mixed while being stirred. The mixed solution containing both metals was added 

dropwise to the 5.0 g of the extrudates (Zeolyst CBV 28014 CY 1.5, containing 80 wt.% H-ZSM-5 with 

SiO2/Al2O3 = 280 and 20 wt.% alumina as the binder) while the extrudates were being stirred. It is noted 

that the volume of solution was in slight excess of the pore volume of the extrudates. The flask containing 

the impregnated extrudates were connected to a rotary evaporator instrument, which then rotated at a 

slow speed at room temperature for three hours for gentle vaporization. Consequently, the extrudates 

were dried in an oven at 363 K for three hours. Lastly, the extrudates were removed in a ceramic dish 

and calcined in the air as the following sequence: RT to 373 K at 2 K min−1; held at 373 K for eight hours; 

373 K to 453 K at 2 K min−1; held at 543 K for three hours. 

The recipe was scaled-up by Zeolyst in a 500-g batch (ID: ZD15014A), which has a composition 

of 0.3 wt.% Ir–0.3 wt.% Pt supported on γ-Al2O3–H-ZSM-5 (1.6 mm extrudates, 80 wt.% H-ZSM-5 with 

SiO2/Al2O3 = 280, and 20 wt.% γ-Al2O3 as the binder). 

2.2 Reaction 

2.2.1 Unit 136, 0.25-inch OD reactor 

The 1.6 mm catalyst extrudates were sized into 0.4-0.8 mm particles. The particles (0.05–1 g) 

were diluted with 0.4-0.8 mm silicon carbide before being packed in the center of the stainless-steel 

tubular reactors (¼-in OD, 0.039-in wall thickness). The mixture of catalyst and diluent formed a 4-in bed. 

The bed was held in place by glass wool, a spacer, and a mesh gasket. Thermocouples (TCs) were 

positioned on the outer wall of the reactor to control the wall temperatures. The packed reactor was 

placed in a three-zone furnace, and an internal thermocouple is placed at the center of the catalyst bed 

to measure the reaction temperature, as shown in Figure 4A. The temperature difference between the 

wall and the bed was always below 0.5 K. 

Hydrogen gas (Airgas, 99.999% purity) and ethane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) were controlled and 

delivered to the reactor system by Bronkhorst® EL-FLOW® Prestige gas mass flow controllers. The n-

butane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), i-butane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), mixed butanes (Airgas, 30-70 wt.% n-

butane of 99.99% purity, balanced by i-butane of 99.99% purity), or propane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) 

feed was controlled and delivered in liquid form by Bronkhorst® mini CORI-FLOW™ liquid mass flow 

controllers, from cylinders pressurized with helium. 

The reaction temperature was between 520 and 600 K, with an H2/HC molar ratio of 0.15 – 10 

and a WHSV of 3.5 – 200 gHC gcat
−1 h−1 (or simply h−1), under a pressure of 4 – 12 bar. Some example 

experimental conditions are summarized in the Appendix section. 

An online Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph analyzed the product gas stream. The pressure in 

the sample loops was equilibrated to ambient pressure before every GC injection. Sampled components 

were separated in an Agilent J&W GS-GasPro column (0.32 mm × 30 m) followed by an FID using He 

(Airgas, 99.999% purity) as the carrier gas. The peak areas identified by GC were used to determine the 

conversion of hydrocarbons, as well as selectivity of products. The volume expansion factor 𝜈 was 

calculated as:

where 𝛺𝑖 and 𝑐𝑖 refer to the degree of unsaturation for a hydrocarbon product 𝑖 (i.e., 1 for each double 

bond, 1 for each ring) and volumetric concentration of product 𝑖 in the product stream, respectively. Since 

the products in butane hydrogenolysis reaction are nearly exclusively alkanes, 𝜈 ≈ 1 applies to almost all 

experiments in this study.

The 1.6 mm catalyst extrudates were sized into 0.4-0.8 mm particles. The particles (0.05–0.75 g) 

were diluted with 0.4-0.8 mm silicon carbide before being packed in the center of the stainless-steel 

tubular reactors (¼-in OD, 0.039-in wall thickness). The mixture of catalyst and diluent formed a 3-in bed. 

The bed was held in place by glass wool, a spacer, and a mesh gasket. The packed reactor was covered 

by aluminum sleeves (to achieve a more nearly isothermal profile across the reactor) and placed in a 

two-zone furnace, as shown in Figure 4B. Three internal TCs were evenly distributed across the catalyst 

bed (two for controlling and one for monitoring). The temperature difference across the three TCs was 

always below 0.5 K. 

The H2 (Praxair, 99.999% purity) was controlled and delivered to the reactor system by Brooks 

5850E gas mass flow controllers controlled by secondary electronics. Normal butane (Praxair, 99.99% 

purity), isobutane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), mixed butanes (Airgas, 30-70 wt.% n-butane, 99.99% purity, 

balanced by i-butane, 99.99% purity), or propane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) was controlled and delivered 

in liquid form by Bronkhorst® mini CORI-FLOW™ liquid mass flow controllers, from cylinders pressurized 

with helium. 

An online Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph analyzed the product gas stream. The pressure in 

the sample loops was equilibrated to ambient pressure before every GC injection. One sample gas was 

analyzed with an HP-PLOT Q column (0.53 mm × 30 m × 40 μm) followed by an FID using He (Airgas, 

99.999% purity) as the carrier gas. In parallel, another sample gas was analyzed with a Hayesep Q pre-

column, followed by a Molsieve 5A column and a TCD using Ar (Airgas, 99.999% purity) as the carrier 

gas. The TCD was exclusively for H2 analysis. 

The GC data processing was the same as those in Section 2.2.1 except that 𝑐𝐻2,𝑖𝑛 was directly 

measured by TCD.

3 Results and Discussions 
The preliminary studies on temperature and partial pressure dependences revealed that 

temperature did not have a significant impact on the deactivation rate at the experimental condition 

(Figure 5A). This temperature insensitivity will be addressed in a later section. The trends with partial 

pressures of hydrogen and hydrocarbons provided more insights on the development of the rate 

expression. As is shown in Figure 5B-C, the effects of partial pressure on the deactivation rate were not 

monotonic: For both hydrogen and hydrocarbon partial pressures, the deactivation rate reached a 

maximum when evaluated across a wide range. A conventional view on catalyst deactivation is that the 

deactivation can be mitigated by increasing hydrogen partial pressure or lowering hydrocarbon partial 

pressure. However, the results in Figure 5 show that the effects of hydrogen and hydrocarbons can be 

complicated. Specifically, the catalyst deactivation rates moderated when the hydrogen partial pressure 

was low enough (dotted line in Figure 5B), or the hydrocarbon partial pressure was high enough (dashed 

line in Figure 5C). The model development in the following section will be dedicated to illustrate this 

phenomenon.

and (C) butane partial pressure. The conversion (𝜒) refers to the hydrogen conversion. 

3.1 Derivation of the model 

Despite their counter-intuitive nature, it is possible to interpret the results in Figure 5 by a 

Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression. To reach a maximum in deactivation rate while varying the 

hydrocarbon partial pressure (𝑝𝑓), the exponent on 𝑝𝑓 needs to be greater in the denominator than that 

in the numerator. One possible way to achieve this is to have an open site involved in the rate-determining 

step (RDS). The derivation of the rate expression is presented below. 

Figure 6 illustrates three-step surface reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation. A hydrocarbon 

molecule, under quasi-equilibrium with constant 𝐾𝑚 , reacts with surface open sites, and loses 𝛼 

molecules of H2 to form the most abundant surface intermediate (MASI). The MASI does not have to 

participate in the rate-determining step of the deactivation reaction directly. Accordingly, a second quasi-

equilibrium step (with constant 𝐾𝑑) is introduced to allow the precursor in the deactivation RDS to be 

different from the MASI. The formed deactivation precursor (DP) interacts with an open site in the 

deactivation reaction. Note that these surface reactions are lumps of multiple elementary steps and are 

not meant to address the mechanism at a micro-kinetics level.

Figure 6. Schematic pathway of surface reactions leading to deactivation, which is composed of a quasi-
equilibrium step (with equilibrium constant Km) of surface adsorption to from MASI, a quasi-equilibrium 
step (with equilibrium constant Kd) to from deactivation precursor, and a rate-determining step (with rate 
constant kd) to form deactivated sites. 

In the process of deriving the rate expression, for simplicity, the feed is denoted as “f,” while the 

open site, adsorbed hydrogen, MASI, and DP are denoted in the following equations as “0”, “h,” “m,” and 

“d,” respectively.

where 𝜃𝑚, 𝐾𝑚, 𝑝𝑓, 𝜃0, and 𝑝𝐻2 refer to the surface coverage of MASI, the equilibrium constant between 

the gaseous feed and MASI, the partial pressure of the feed, the surface coverage of open sites, and the 

partial pressure of H2. 

Assuming 𝜃𝑚 ≫ 𝜃𝑑, the site balance can be written as 

𝜃𝑚 + 𝜃ℎ + 𝜃0 = 𝛩 (7) 

where 𝛩 is the number of active sites, which changes with time on stream. The value of 𝛩 is normalized 

by the initial number of active sites on a fresh catalyst. 

The coverage of open sites (𝜃0) and adsorbed hydrogen (𝜃ℎ) can be related, based on the process

separate 𝐴𝑖 and 𝐴𝑖 with associated 𝐸𝑎,𝑖, 𝛼𝑖, 𝛿𝑖, and 𝑄𝑖 for each. Via a similar process to eq (8)-(18) and

Since 𝛩 is not directly measurable, it must be related to H2 conversion, which is a descriptor of 

catalyst activity. The conversion of H2 is preferred over that of a hydrocarbon because a product of 

hydrogenolysis may undergo further hydrogenolysis to form even shorter alkanes. 

In an LH kinetic expression, the exponent of 𝛩 in the denominator should be equivalent to the 

number of sites in the reaction RDS. It is noteworthy that all the RDS of the reaction rates developed 

previously19 are LH-type and involve two sites. Therefore, the reaction rate of H2 can be expressed as: 

−
𝑑𝑁𝐻2
𝑑𝑙

= 𝑘𝑅(𝑝𝑖,𝑇)𝛩
2 (25) 

where 𝑙 refers to the fractional axial reactor length, and 𝑘𝑅 is the lumped reaction rate constant. 

Therefore, the conversion can be expressed as:

𝛩2 (26) 

At differential conditions, temperature (𝑇) and the partial pressures (𝑝𝑖 ) can be considered 

constant across the reactor, and the conversion increases linearly with the reactor length (𝐿).

Since 𝑝𝑖 and 𝑇 undergo insignificant change across the length of a differential reactor, 𝑘𝑅(𝑝𝑖,𝑇) 

can be treated as a constant. Therefore, the ratio between the real-time conversion and the initial 

conversion can be written as:

As is shown in Figure 8B, an activity decay curve (indicated by circles) often has two portions. 

The first part is a relatively fast deactivation occurring towards the beginning of the experiment, and the 

second one corresponds to a relatively slow deactivation. The initial fast deactivation is likely associated 

with the induction period of the catalyst, during which the catalyst may still be stabilizing structurally and 

highly uncoordinated sites are passivated. The post-induction deactivation at relatively slow rates is 

associated with the majority of the active sites, and better reflects the deactivation behavior of the catalyst 

during prolonged operation. Therefore, the final step in data processing is to remove the impact of the 

induction period on catalyst deactivation as the following: 

 Extrapolating (dashed line in Figure 8A) the post-induction linear part of the curve (as the 

curve formed by the circles in Figure 8A becomes linear) to time zero; 

 Using the corresponding value of the intercept to normalize the initial performance back to 

unity (dotted line in Figure 8A), which matches eq (29).

ensure that the back extrapolation of the post-induction decay curve (dotted line in Figure 8) starts at 1

3.2 Fitting the model 

Upon the completion of the model development and data processing, the following section will be 

dedicated to the model fitting, which minimizes the difference between the experimental data and the 

modeled analog. With a given pair of measured and simulated deactivation rate constants (𝑘𝐷,𝑀 and 𝑘𝐷,𝑆, 

respectively), which correspond to Point P in the parity plot (Figure 9A), the residual (e) is defined by: 

𝑒 =
𝑑1
𝑑2

=
𝑘𝐷,𝑆 − 𝑘𝐷,𝑀
𝑘𝐷,𝑆 + 𝑘𝐷,𝑀

 (30) 

The fitting parameters were optimized by minimizing the sum of residual squares (∑𝑒𝑖
2 ) using the 

Generalized Reduced Gradient non-linear regression algorithm in the Excel Solver package. Since 100 

sets of initial guesses were applied during the optimization, the result can be treated as a global one or 

a semi-global one. 

A few restrictions were applied when performing the model fitting. It is reasonable to assume that 

all the linear alkanes form similar MASIs. In the present work, the α values of linear alkanes (see eq (22)) 

were fixed to two, which is projected by a DFT simulation in Ref 8. It means that the MASI associated 

with a linear alkane has four less hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkane feed. It is worth noting 

that MASI in hydrogenolysis has also been reported as −3H from linear alkanes11-12, but the −4H premise 

yielded a better fitting result than the −3H one in this study. On the other hand, the 𝛼 value for i-butane 

varied during the fitting considering its distinct reactivity13 and likely different hydrogenolysis mechanism7 

compared to the linear alkanes. Applying the Born–Haber cycle, the formation of the MASI (see Figure 

6) on the catalyst surface can be divided into quasi-equilibrated dehydrogenation and chemisorption 

steps. The reaction endotherm to dehydrogenate the same number of hydrogen atoms and the 

corresponding chemisorption exotherm can be very similar for short alkanes10. Therefore, 𝑄, which is a 

combination of dehydrogenation endotherm and adsorption exotherm, was restricted to be the same 

during the fit. Furthermore, 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖 ≥ 0.5 was also enforced with the assumption that it needs to dissociate 

as least one H atom to form a surface-bonded DP (see Figure 6). The applied restrictions can also be 

found in the footnotes of Table 1.

A total of 23 fitting parameters were determined with 112 experiments in differential reactors. 

Upon the completion of the model fitting, an analysis of the residuals revealed that the numbers 

possessed good normality (Figure 9B), indicating good quality of fit. The parity plots containing all the 

runs with various feeds (Figure 10A) and separated ones with individual feeds (Figure 10B-F) show that 

the data points are evenly distributed along the parity line, regardless of the feed. It demonstrated that 

the fitting was not biased toward specific feeds. Figure 11 compares the modeled and measured 

deactivation profiles in the space of normalized conversion activity (hydrogen conversion). The modeled 

curves very much overlap with the corresponding measured ones.

Table 1 lists the fitting parameters derived herein. The value of 𝑬𝒂 for n-butane is close to zero, 

which is consistent with the temperature insensitivity displayed in Figure 5. The activation energy (𝑬𝒂) of 

normal-alkane-induced deactivation follows ethane > propane > n-butane, and the pre-exponential factor 

(𝐴) follows ethane < propane < n-butane. It suggests that the rate of deactivation caused by linear alkanes 

increases with the carbon chain length. An akin trend can be found in the literature on the reaction rate 

of alkane hydrogenolysis6, which showed that the bond activation becomes easier as the carbon chain 

lengthens. Similarly, the 𝐵 value follows ethane < propane < n-butane, which is consistent with the higher 

tendency of chemisorption as the carbon chain grows6. It should also be noted that the 𝐸𝑎 value of i-

butane is quite negative, drastically different from those of linear alkanes. It implies that i-butane may 

undergo different deactivation pathways from those of linear alkanes shown in Figure 6. However, 

differentiating i-butane would result in tremendous numerical difficulty expressing the rate, from which 

the number of active site Θ can be separated and integrated. Addressing such difference would likely 

require more detailed studies on i-butane separately and is out of the scope of this study. 

The fitting results also show that i-butane loses two hydrogen atoms (α ≈ 1) to form its MASI, and 

its DP contains more hydrogen atoms than the MASIs (𝛿 < 0). As is shown by Iglesia and co-authors7, 

the C-C bond breaking of i-butane requires it to lose six hydrogen atoms before breaking a C–C bond. 

Therefore, the DP of i-butane, which could be only one H atom short of i-butane (2(α+δ) in Table 1), may 

not undergo C–C bond cleavage in the deactivation RDS. Similarly, propane needs to lose four hydrogen 

atoms before its C–C bond cleavage in hydrogenolysis6, which is one more hydrogen than its modeled 

DP. The propane deactivation RDS hence may not need to activate the C–C, either. The fitting results

suggest, however, the DPs for ethane and n-butane are also their MASIs (δ ≈ 0), so the C–C bond 

activation cannot be ruled out from their deactivation routes. 

The  value is at 1.40, which is considerably larger than one. It means that the rate-determining 

step of deactivation may involve multiple surface hydrocarbon species. Consequently, coke formation 

cannot be excluded as a slow secondary reaction based on the current analysis. 

Table 1 suggests that i-butane, along with ethane, is a feed causing least deactivation. However, 

i-butane played an important role on the deactivation rate as a consequence of competitive adsorption. 

Figure 12 compares the deactivation rates at 570 K in the H2/C4H10-pressure space using feeds with 

different composition. The pure n-butane feed (Figure 12A) always has the highest deactivation rate in 

the entire plotted range, and the deactivation lessened as the share of i-butane in the butane mixture 

increased.

Figure 13 maps the deactivation rate constant in the temperature-pressure space at various 

H2/C4H10 (70% n-butane and 30% i-butane) ratios. At H2/C4H10 = 5, the deactivation rate increases with 

temperature in the entire pressure range in the map (Figure 13C). As the H2/C4H10 decreases, a zone in 

which the deactivation rate decreases with temperature emerges at the low-pressure end (Figure 13B). 

When H2/C4H10 = 1, the deactivation rate slightly decreases with temperature in the entire mapped range 

of pressures (Figure 13A). In industrial reactors, as the catalyst deactivates, it is a common practice to 

increase the reactor temperature incrementally to maintain the catalyst activity. As is shown in Figure 

13A, when operating at a sufficiently low H2/C4H10, it is possible to decelerate the deactivation as the 

reactor undergoes incremental temperature changes, which extends the catalyst lifetime. 

Figure 14 maps the deactivation rate constant in the H2/C4H10-pressure space at various 

temperatures. At any given temperature and pressure within the presented range in Figure 13, the 

deactivation rate reaches a maximum while increasing the H2/C4H10 from 1 to 10. At 550 K (Figure 14A), 

the deactivation rates are relatively slow, when H2/C4H10 and pressure are either both low or both high. 

As temperature increases, the deactivation rate remains slow in the low-H2/C4H10-low-pressure (LHLP) 

zone. In contrast, outside of the LHLP zone, the deactivation rate increases substantially with 

temperature. Therefore, the LHLP zone is the most desired window of operation to minimize catalyst 

deactivation. 

 
Figure 14. 2D map (H2/C4H10 and pressure) of deactivation rate constants at (A) 550 K, (B) 570 K, and 
(C) 590 K for a C4H10 feed composed of 70% n-butane and 30% i-butane. 

Figure 15 compares the deactivation rate and the reaction rate (from n-butane to ethane, see Ref 

8) at 570 K in the same ranges of H2/C4H10 and pressure. The most favorable range of operation is where 

slow deactivation rates overlap with fast reaction rates. According to Figure 15, such overlap can be 

accomplished in the range where H2/C4H10 and pressure are both low (bottom left corner). 

The model provides a powerful tool to predict the catalyst deactivation behavior. However, since 

the model was developed based on data generated from isothermal reactors, it did not consider the effect 

of temperature rise. Given the fact that the deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is largely adsorption 

driven, a rising temperature could start to make the final step in Figure 6 reversible and hence desorb 

the deactivating species. Consequently, in a pilot or industrial reactor in which temperature increments 

are applied to maintain the catalyst activity, the deactivation may become partially reversible as the 

reactor temperature rises. Nonetheless, the model is sufficient to project the trend of deactivation as the

reaction conditions change, such as the maps in Figures 13-15. Moreover, the model provides insights 

on the formula of MASI, the similarity/difference between MASI and DP, and the possibility of both 

monomolecular and bi-molecular deactivation routes. One may refer to the explanatory paragraphs of 

Table 1 for more details. 

 
Figure 15. 2D map of (A) deactivation rate constant (𝑘𝐷) and (B) reaction rate constant (𝑘𝑅) at 570 K in 
H2/C4H10-pressure space. The C4H10 feed was composed of 70% n-butane and 30% i-butane.  

 
Figure 16. The evolution of deactivation profiles at the H2/C4H10 goes below one at (A) 548 K and (B) 583 
K. The reactor pressure was kept at 7.9 bar. The feed was composed of 70% n-butane and 30% i-butane. 

The model was not developed to cover all possible conditions. Without limits on conditions, the 

model would project that the deactivation rate will continue to decrease monotonically as H2/C4H10 

decreases. However, severe deactivation would certainly occur when there is no H2 in the reaction gas. 

The model is most accurate when H2/C4H10 ≥ 1. Although reducing H2/C4H10 to below one can 

continuously decelerate deactivation to some extent, further decreasing H2/C4H10 would reverse the trend. 

As is shown in Figure 16A, at 548 K and 7.9 bar, the deactivation rate kept decreasing as H2/C4H10

dropped from 1.01 to 0.58. Once the H2/C4H10 went below 0.58, the deactivation started to accelerate. It 

is noteworthy that the deactivation was still at a moderate rate when the H2/C4H10 was as low as 0.15. 

Similarly, at 583 K (Figure 16B), the deactivation rate kept dropping until H2/C4H10 reached 0.65. The 

deactivation started to rise with further decreasing H2/C4H10. The deactivation rate remained moderate at 

H2/C4H10 = 0.51, but accelerated substantially as H2/C4H10 went down to 0.38 and further to 0.15. 

As stated above, the most desirable condition to mitigate catalyst deactivation is hydrogen-lean 

(below the reaction stoichiometry). The single-bed butane conversion is hence limited. Additional reactors 

need to be sequenced to raise the overall butane conversion. It should also be noted that the ethane 

selectivity, as projected by the LH kinetic model8, decays as H2/C4H10 decreases (Figure 17). However, 

the loss of ethane selectivity can be effectively recovered by inter-stage H2 addition in a multiple-reactor 

setup. Such a setup is separately addressed in an invention disclosure14. 

 
Figure 17. The evolution of ethane selectivity as the H2/C4H10 goes below one at (A) 548 K and (B) 583 
K. The reactor pressure was kept at 7.9 bar. The feed was composed of 70% n-butane and 30% i-butane. 

4 Conclusions and future works 
The deactivation of an Ir-Pt catalyst in butane hydrogenolysis follows a unique trend, where it can 

be more stable in hydrogen-lean conditions than hydrogen-rich ones. Such a counter-intuitive 

phenomenon can be modeled and explained by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood deactivation model based on 

reasonably hypothesized surface reactions. The model aligns well with the experimental results in 

differential reactors. 

Compared to the previously used benchmark testing conditions, hydrogen-lean conditions can 

significantly extend the catalyst lifetime at a higher reaction rate. The learnings from this model can 

substantially shorten reactor downtime, shrink the reactor size to achieve the same production rate, and 

reduce the cost of separating H2. 

The model will be used to align with the existing pilot data and provide guidelines for future piloting 

trials.

Title:	Deactivation modeling of an Ir-Pt catalyst in butane hydrogenolysis reaction
Project:	Butane to Ethane (Accolade # 116955)
Authors†:	Heng Shou, Ashwin Patel, Cong Nguyen, and Byeongjin Baek
executive summary
The deactivation of the butane hydrogenolysis catalyst was modeled using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression. It is among the first efforts to model reaction-induced catalyst deactivation via reasonably hypothesized surface reactions. More importantly, it is the first discovery on a counter-intuitive phenomenon, in which precious metal catalyst can be more stable in hydrogen-lean conditions than hydrogen-rich ones in hydrocarbon processing. Despite the counter-intuition, such a phenomenon phenomena is consistent with the projection by the deactivation model.
When comparing to the previously used benchmark testing conditions, the hydrogen-lean conditions can significantly extend the catalyst lifetime at a higher rate of reaction. The learnings from the model can substantially shorten reactor downtime, shrink the reactor size to achieve the same production rate, and reduce the cost of separating excessive H2.

[bookmark: _Toc30599725]Introduction
The definition of a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction and cyclically turns over to its original state as the reaction completes. The implied situation is that the catalyst remains unchanged during this process. However, in all catalytic reactions, catalyst deactivation is as certain as death and taxes. Figure 1 shows the deactivation time for some processes. The time scale of deactivation has profound consequences for process design. The environmental catalysts for automobiles are required to last as long as the vehicle’s lifetime mileage. The processes with long catalyst lifetime (months to years) suit well in fixed-bed reactors. Those with shorter lifetime require slurry or moving-bed reactors. A process like FCC, where the zeolite catalyst can merely last for seconds, needs a catalyst regenerator that is larger than the reactor.

Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the deactivation phenomena inside a catalyst particle. Attrition is directly related to the structural integrity of the catalyst substrates, which is under rigorous tests, when the catalyst particles are in motion; hence, attrition hence ,especially, applies to moving-bed, fluid-bed, and slurry-bed reactors. Sintering refers to the process of catalyst particles agglomerating, which requires high enough temperature to mobilize them. Deactivation also occurs when the catalyst reacts with a reactant to form a volatile species in a gas-phase reaction or a soluble species in a liquid-phase reaction (leaching), such as anchored Suzuki catalysts for cross coupling2. Poisoning is often caused by impurities in the feed; example poisons are arsenic and sulfur on a CoMo hydrotreating catalyst supported on alumina or faujasite, where arsenic poisons both the metal and the substrate and sulfur poisoning mostly applies to the metals. Fouling is caused by reactions promoted by the catalyst itself; in this process, strongly adsorbed species are formed, which render their adsorption sites inactive.
The cause of catalyst deactivation is highly specific to the application; we will consider here the deactivation phenomena during hydrogenolysis of alkanes. It is generally regarded as mono-functional chemistry occurring on metals. Iglesia and co-workers detailed the micro-kinetics of the process2-7. As is shown in Figure 3, as the linear alkane undergoes multiple dehydrogenation steps, two adjacent carbon atoms are co-adsorbed on the metal surface; this establishes the conditions for C–C bond cleavage. Finally, the highly dehydrogenated fragments on the metal surface react with H2 to desorb and form shorter alkanes.

Given that the butane hydrogenolysis reaction on the Ir-Pt catalyst was conducted at moderate conditions (520-600 K, 4.5-11.4 bar) in a reducing environment, the metal clusters on the substrate should have limited mobility and volatility. The reaction was carried in fixed-bed reactors, so the structural integrity of the catalyst substrate is of minor concern. The feed has negligible impurities, especially, the non-hydrocarbon ones, so the catalyst ought to have limited exposure to poisons. Therefore, it appears likely that catalyst deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is due to fouling, caused by surface deposits formed during the reaction. It is consistent with the reaction mechanism of alkane hydrogenolysis presented in Figure 3, during which highly dehydrogenated surface intermediates are formed.
This study is based on the premise that the deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is mainly from fouling. Preliminary observations suggested that the deactivation could be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) type kinetics, and a deactivation model was developed accordingly using an approach similar to primary reaction kinetics based on reasonably hypothesized and simplified surface reactions. The presented work is among the first efforts to model catalyst deactivation using an LH rate expression.
The findings herein suggest that elevating hydrogen partial pressure or lowering hydrocarbon partial pressure is not always the most effective means of mitigating catalyst deactivation. In fact, catalyst lifetime could be significantly extended, when hydrogen was relatively lean, even slightly below reaction stoichiometry, which is unprecedented in literature reports. Besides, the Furthermorefurthermore, the hydrogen-lean conditions coincide with a faster reaction rate, which implies that the same production capacity may be achieved with a smaller reactor size.

According to a previous report8, the following recipe was transferred to Zeolyst for scaling up. An aqueous solution was made by dissolving 0.042 g of H2IrCl6·6H2O (Aldrich) in 3.0 mL D.I. water. Similarly, an aqueous solution was made by dissolving 0.042 g of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich) in 1.0 mL of D.I. water. The two solutions were mixed while being stirred. The mixed solution containing both metals was added dropwise to the 5.0 g of the extrudates (Zeolyst CBV 28014 CY 1.5, containing 80 wt.% H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 = 280 and 20 wt.% alumina as the binder) while the extrudates were being stirred. It is noted that the volume of solution was in slight excess of the pore volume of the extrudates. The flask containing the impregnated extrudates were connected to a rotary evaporator instrument, which then rotated at a slow speed at room temperature for three hours for gentle vaporization. Consequently, the extrudates were dried in an oven at 363 K for three hours. Lastly, the extrudates were removed in a ceramic dish and calcined in the air as the following sequence: RT to 373 K at 2 K min−1; held at 373 K for eight hours; 373 K to 453 K at 2 K min−1; held at 543 K for three hours.
The recipe was scaled-up by Zeolyst in a 500-g batch (ID: ZD15014A), which has a composition of 0.3 wt.% Ir–0.3 wt.% Pt supported on γ-Al2O3–H-ZSM-5 (1.6 mm extrudates, 80 wt.% H-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 = 280, and 20 wt.% γ-Al2O3 as the binder).

The 1.6 mm catalyst extrudates were sized into 0.4-0.8 mm particles. The particles (0.05–1 g) were diluted with 0.4-0.8 mm silicon carbide before being packed in the center of the stainless-steel tubular reactors (¼-in OD, 0.039-in wall thickness). The mixture of catalyst and diluent formed a 4-in bed. The bed was held in place by glass wool, a spacer, and a mesh gasket. Thermocouples were positioned on the outer wall of the reactor to control the wall temperatures. The packed reactor was placed in a three-zone furnace, and an internal thermocouple is placed at the center of the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature, as shown in Figure 4A. The temperature difference between the wall and the bed was always below 0.5 °C.
Hydrogen gas (Airgas, 99.999% purity) and ethane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) were controlled and delivered to the reactor system by Bronkhorst® EL-FLOW® Prestige gas mass flow controllers. The n-butane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), i-butane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), mixed butanes (Airgas, 30-70 wt.% n-butane of 99.99% purity, balanced by i-butane of 99.99% purity), or propane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) feed was controlled and delivered in liquid form by Bronkhorst® mini CORI-FLOW™ liquid mass flow controllers, from cylinders pressurized with helium.
The reaction temperature was between 520 and 600 K, with an H2/HC molar ratio of 0.15 – 10 and a WHSV of 3.5 – 200 gHC gcat−1 h−1 (or simply h−1), under a pressure of 4 – 12 bar. Some example experimental conditions are summarized in the Appendix section.
An online Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph analyzed the product gas stream. The pressure in the sample loops was equilibrated to ambient pressure before every GC injection. Sampled components were separated in an Agilent J&W GS-GasPro column (0.32 mm × 30 m) followed by an FID using He (Airgas, 99.999% purity) as the carrier gas. The peak areas identified by GC were used to determine the conversion of hydrocarbons, as well as selectivity of products. The volume expansion factor  was calculated as:

Unit 143, 0.25-inch OD reactors
The 1.6 mm catalyst extrudates were sized into 0.4-0.8 mm particles. The particles (0.05–0.75 g) were diluted with 0.4-0.8 mm silicon carbide before being packed in the center of the stainless-steel tubular reactors (¼-in OD, 0.039-in wall thickness). The mixture of catalyst and diluent formed a 3-in bed. The bed was held in place by glass wool, a spacer, and a mesh gasket. The packed reactor was covered by aluminum sleeves (to achieve a more nearly isothermal profile across the reactor) and placed in a two-zone furnace, as shown in Figure 4B. Two thermocouples were positioned on the thermal sleeve reactor to control the sleeve temperature, and an internal thermocouple is placed at the center of the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature. The temperature difference between the sleeve and the bed was always below 0.5 °C.
The H2 (Praxair, 99.999% purity) was controlled and delivered to the reactor system by Brooks 5850E gas mass flow controllers controlled by secondary electronics. Normal butane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), isobutane (Praxair, 99.99% purity), mixed butanes (Airgas, 30-70 wt.% n-butane, 99.99% purity, balanced by i-butane, 99.99% purity), or propane (Praxair, 99.99% purity) was controlled and delivered in liquid form by Bronkhorst® mini CORI-FLOW™ liquid mass flow controllers, from cylinders pressurized with helium.
An online Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph analyzed the product gas stream. The pressure in the sample loops was equilibrated to ambient pressure before every GC injection. One sample gas was analyzed with an HP-PLOT Q column (0.53 mm × 30 m × 40 μm) followed by an FID using He (Airgas, 99.999% purity) as the carrier gas. In parallel, another sample gas was analyzed with a Hayesep Q pre-column, followed by a Molsieve 5A column and a TCD using Ar (Airgas, 99.999% purity) as the carrier gas. The TCD was exclusively for H2 analysis.
The GC data processing was the same as those in Section 2.2.1 except that  was directly measured by TCD.
[bookmark: _Toc30599729]Results and Discussions
The preliminary studies on temperature and partial pressure dependences revealed that temperature did not have a significant impact on the deactivation rate at the experimental condition (Figure 5A). This temperature insensitivity will be addressed in a later section. The trends with partial pressures of hydrogen and hydrocarbons provided more insights on the development of the rate expression. As is shown in Figure 5B-C, the effects of partial pressure on the deactivation rate were not monotonic: For both hydrogen and hydrocarbon partial pressures, the deactivation rate reached a maximum when evaluated across a wide range. A conventional view on catalyst deactivation is that the deactivation can be mitigated by increasing hydrogen partial pressure or lowering hydrocarbon partial pressure. However, the results in Figure 5 show that the effects of hydrogen and hydrocarbons can be complicated. Specifically, the catalyst deactivation rates moderated when the hydrogen partial pressure was low enough (dotted line in Figure 5B), or the hydrocarbon partial pressure was high enough (dashed line in Figure 5C). The model development in the following section will be dedicated to illustrate this phenomenon.

[bookmark: _Toc30599730]Derivation of the model
Despite their counter-intuitive nature, it is possible to interpret the results in Figure 5 by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression. To reach a maximum in deactivation rate while varying the hydrocarbon partial pressure (), the exponent on  needs to be greater in the denominator than that in the numerator. One possible way to achieve this is to have an open site involved in the rate-determining step (RDS). The derivation of the rate expression is presented below.
Figure 6 illustrates three-step surface reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation. A hydrocarbon molecule, under quasi-equilibrium with constant , reacts with surface open sites, and loses  molecules of H2 to form the most abundant surface intermediate (MASI). The MASI does not have to participate in the rate-determining step of the deactivation reaction directly. Accordingly, a second quasi-equilibrium step (with constant ) is introduced to allow the precursor in the deactivation RDS to be different from the MASI. The formed deactivation precursor interacts with an open site in the deactivation reaction. Note that these surface reactions are lumps of multiple elementary steps and are not meant to address the mechanism at a micro-kinetics level.

In the process of deriving the rate expression, for simplicity, the feed is denoted as “f,” while the open site, adsorbed hydrogen, MASI, and deactivation precursor are denoted in the following equations as “0”, “h,” “m,” and “d,” respectively.

where  is the number of active sites, which changes with time on stream. The value of is a normalized one based on the initial number of active sites on a fresh catalyst.
The coverage of open sites () and adsorbed hydrogen () can be related, based on the process of dissociative adsorption of H2 shown in Figure 7, as:

Based on the second equilibrium (from MASI to deactivation precursor, described by ) in Figure 6, the coverage of deactivation precursor is:

The rate of deactivation is approximately that of the rate-determining step (RDS) in Figure 6:

Here,  is the pre-exponential factor of the deactivation RDS. The  and  values represent the Gibbs free energy change and the enthalpy change of corresponding reactions, respectively.
Substituting the symbols in eq (12) with eq (13)-(16), the deactivation rate becomes:
	
	(17)


For simplicity, the parameters that are not temperature- or pressure-dependent are lumped into single fitting parameters in the pre-exponential factors and the exponents. The deactivation rate expression is then:
	
	[bookmark: _Ref29455293](18)


If multiple hydrocarbon compounds contribute to the deactivation process, the total number of active sites now include the corresponding MASIs from various hydrocarbons:
	
	[bookmark: _Ref28960767][bookmark: _Ref28947558][bookmark: _Ref28961465](19)


Each hydrocarbon  contributes to the overall rate of site loss in a parallel fashion, giving rise to separate  and  with associated , , , and  for each. Via a similar process to eq (8)-(18) and summing the portions from different compounds, the total rate of deactivation is:
	
	(20)


The number of open sites and surface species involved in the RDS of the deactivation reaction may vary. Therefore, two more parameters ( for open sites and  for DP) are introduced to assess such likelihood. Assuming all the alkanes undergo similar deactivation pathways, the total deactivation rate turns out as:
	
	[bookmark: _Ref30597791][bookmark: _Ref29113893](21)


For a given constant set of conditions (pressure, temperature, composition), the deactivation process may described by eq (21), in which an overall deactivation rate constant  is defined as eq (22). Here, the partial pressure values were approximated to the average of reactor inlet and outlet. 
	
	[bookmark: _Ref29113767][bookmark: _Ref29470246][bookmark: _Ref29113814](22)


The deactivation rate hence becomes:
	
	[bookmark: _Ref30594635][bookmark: _Ref28947653](23)


Integrating both sides with the boundary condition of  at time zero gives the time-dependent number of active sites :
	
	[bookmark: _Ref31116250][bookmark: _Ref29051593](24)


Since  is not directly measurable, it must be related to H2 conversion, which is a descriptor of catalyst activity. The conversion of H2 is preferred over that of a hydrocarbon, because a product of hydrogenolysis may undergo further hydrogenolysis to form even shorter alkanes.
In an LH kinetic expression, the exponent of  in the denominator should be equivalent to the number of sites in the reaction RDS. It is noteworthy that all the RDS of the reaction rates developed previously20 are LH-type and involve two sites. Therefore, the reaction rate of H2 can be expressed as:
	
	(25)


where  refers to the fractional axial reactor length.
Therefore, the conversion can be expressed as:
	
	(26)


At differential conditions, temperature () and the partial pressures () can be considered constant across the reactor, and the conversion increases linearly with the reactor length ().

Since  and  undergo insignificant change across the length of a differential reactor,  can be treated as a constant. Therefore, the ratio between the real-time conversion and the initial conversion can be written as:

As is shown in Figure 8B, an activity decay curve (indicated by circles) often has two portions. The first part is a relatively fast deactivation occurring towards the beginning of the experiment, and the second one corresponds to a relatively slow deactivation. The initial fast deactivation is likely associated with the induction period of the catalyst, during which the catalyst may still be stabilizing structurally and highly uncoordinated sites are passivated. The post-induction deactivation at relatively slow rates is associated with the majority of the active sites, and better reflects the deactivation behavior of the catalyst during prolonged operation. Therefore, the final step in data processing is to remove the impact of the induction period on catalyst deactivation as the following:
· Extrapolating (dashed line in Figure 8A) the post-induction linear part of the curve (as the curve formed by the circles in Figure 8A becomes linear) to time zero;
· Using the corresponding value of the intercept to normalize the initial performance back to unity (dotted line in Figure 8A), which matches eq (29).
The corresponding data processing in the space of  is shown in Figure 8B, where the normalization of the post-induction decay results in the intercept of the extrapolation line (dotted) at . The derived value from the data processing is  as shown in eq (22). It should be noticed that values of   and  vary while fitting the model. The data processing adjust the change of  and  accordingly to ensure that the back extrapolation of the post-induction decay curve (dotted line in Figure 8) starts at 1 at time zero.

[bookmark: _Toc30599731]Fitting the model
Upon the completion of the model development and data processing, the following section will be dedicated to the model fitting, which minimizes the difference between the experimental data and the modeled analog. With a given pair of measured and simulated deactivation rate constants ( and , respectively), which correspond to Point P in the parity plot (Figure 9A), the residual (e) is defined by:
	
	(30)


The fitting parameters were optimized by minimizing the sum of residual squares () using the Generalized Reduced Gradient non-linear regression algorithm in the Excel solver package. Since one hundred initial guesses were applied during the optimization, the result can be treated as a global one or a semi-global one.
A few restrictions were applied when performing the model fitting. It is reasonable to assume that all the linear alkanes form similar MASIs. In the present work, the α values of linear alkanes (see eq (22)) were fixed to two, which is projected by a DFT simulation in Ref 8. It means that the MASI associated with a linear alkane has four less hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkane feed. It is worth noting that MASI in hydrogenolysis has also been reported as −3H from linear alkanes11-12, but the −4H premise yielded a better fitting result than the −3H one in this study. On the other hand, the  value for i-butane varied during the fitting considering its distinct reactivity13 and likely different hydrogenolysis mechanism7 compared to the linear alkanes. Applying the Born–Haber cycle, the formation of the MASI (see Figure 6) on the catalyst surface can be divided into quasi-equilibrated dehydrogenation and chemisorption steps. The reaction endotherm to dehydrogenate the same number of hydrogen atoms and the corresponding chemisorption exotherm can be very similar for short alkanes10. Therefore, , which is a combination of dehydrogenation endotherm and adsorption exotherm, was restricted to be the same during the fit. Furthermore,  was also enforced with the assumption that it needs to dissociate as least one H atom to form a surface-bonded DP (see Figure 6). The applied restrictions can also be found in the footnotes of Table 1.

A total of 23 fitting parameters were determined with 112 experiments in differential reactors. Upon the completion of the model fitting, an analysis of the residuals revealed that the numbers possessed good normality (Figure 9B), indicating good quality of fit. The parity plots containing all the runs with various feeds (Figure 10A) and separated ones with individual feeds (Figure 10B-F) show that the data points are evenly distributed along the parity line, regardless of the choice of feed. It demonstrated that the fitting was not biased toward specific feeds. Figure 11 compares the modeled and measured deactivation profiles in the space of normalized conversion activity (hydrogen conversion). The modeled curves very much overlap with the corresponding measured ones.

Equation to fit: 
a) Restriction of  values during the fit: ethane = propane = n-butane
b) The value of  for linear alkanes were fixed to two, which is projected by DFT simulation in Ref 8.  
c) Restriction of  values during the fit: 
d) Shared value for all species
Table 1 lists the fitting parameters derived herein. The value of  for n-butane is close to zero, which is consistent with the temperature insensitivity displayed in Figure 5. The activation energy () of normal-alkane-induced deactivation follows ethane > propane > n-butane, and the pre-exponential factor () follows ethane < propane < n-butane. It suggests that the rate of deactivation caused by linear alkanes increases with the carbon chain length. An akin trend can be found in the literature on the reaction rate of alkane hydrogenolysis6, which showed that the bond activation becomes easier as the carbon chain lengthens. Similarly, the  value follows ethane < propane < n-butane, which is consistent with the higher tendency of chemisorption as the carbon chain grows6. It should also be noted that the  value of i-butane is quite negative, drastically different from those of linear alkanes. It indicates that i-butane may undergo different deactivation pathways from those of linear alkanes shown in Figure 6. However, differentiating i-butane would result in tremendous numerical difficulty expressing the rate, from which the number of active site  can be separated and integrated. Addressing such difference would likely require more detailed studies on i-butane separately and is out of the scope of this study.
The fitting results also show that i-butane loses two hydrogen atoms (α ≈ 1) to form its MASI, and its DP contains more hydrogen atoms than the MASIs ( < 0). As is shown by Iglesia and co-authors7, the C-C bond breaking of i-butane requires it to lose six hydrogen atoms before breaking a C–C bond. Therefore, the DP of i-butane, which could be only one H atom short of i-butane (2(α+δ) in Table 1), may not undergo C–C bond cleavage in the deactivation RDS. Similarly, propane needs to lose four hydrogen atoms before its C–C bond cleavage in hydrogenolysis6, which is one more hydrogen than its modeled DP. The propane deactivation RDS hence may not need to activate the C–C, either. The fitting results suggest, however, the DPs for ethane and n-butane are also their MASIs (δ ≈ 0), so the C–C bond activation cannot be ruled out from their deactivation routes.
The  value is at 1.40, which is considerably larger than one. It means that the rate-determining step of deactivation may involve multiple surface hydrocarbon species. Consequently, coke formation cannot be excluded as a slow secondary reaction based on the current analysis.
Table 1 suggests that i-butane, along with ethane, is a feed causing least deactivation. However, i-butane played an important role on the deactivation rate as a consequence of competitive adsorption. Figure 12 compares the deactivation rates at 570 K in the H2/C4H10-pressure space using feeds with different composition. The pure n-butane feed (Figure 12A) always has the highest deactivation rate in the entire plotted range, and the deactivation lessened as the share of i-butane in the butane mixture increased.

Figure 13 maps the deactivation rate constant in the temperature-pressure space at various H2/C4H10 (70% n-butane and 30% i-butane) ratios. At H2/C4H10 = 5, the deactivation rate increases with temperature in the entire pressure range in the map (Figure 13C). As the H2/C4H10 decreases, a zone in which the deactivation rate decreases with temperature emerges at the low-pressure end (Figure 13B). When H2/C4H10 = 1, the deactivation rate slightly decreases with temperature in the entire mapped range of pressures (Figure 13A). In industrial reactors, as the catalyst deactivates, it is a common practice to increase the reactor temperature incrementally to maintain the catalyst activity. As is shown in Figure 13A, when operating at a sufficiently low H2/C4H10, it is possible to decelerate the deactivation as the reactor undergoes incremental temperature changes, which extends the catalyst lifetime.
Figure 14 maps the deactivation rate constant in the H2/C4H10-pressure space at various temperatures. At any given temperature and pressure within the presented range in Figure 13, the deactivation rate reaches a maximum while increasing the H2/C4H10 from 1 to 10. At 550 K (Figure 14A), the deactivation rates are relatively slow, when H2/C4H10 and pressure are either both low or both high. As temperature increases, the deactivation rate remains slow in the low-H2/C4H10-low-pressure (LHLP) zone. In contrast, outside of the LHLP zone, the deactivation rate increases substantially with temperature. Therefore, the LHLP zone is the most desired window of operation to minimize catalyst deactivation.

Figure 15 compares the deactivation rate and the reaction rate (from n-butane to ethane, see Ref 8) at 570 K in the same ranges of H2/C4H10 and pressure. The most favorable range of operation is where slow deactivation rates overlap with fast reaction rates. According to Figure 15, such overlap can be accomplished in the range where H2/C4H10 and pressure are both low (bottom left corner).
The model provides a powerful tool to predict the catalyst deactivation behavior. However, since the model was developed based on data generated from isothermal reactors, it did not consider the effect of temperature rise. Given the fact that the deactivation in butane hydrogenolysis is largely adsorption driven, a rising temperature could start to make the final step in Figure 6 reversible and hence desorb the deactivating species. Consequently, in a pilot or industrial reactor in which temperature increments are applied to maintain the catalyst activity, the deactivation may be partially reversed reversible as the reactor temperature rises. Nonetheless, the model is sufficient to project the trend of deactivation as the reaction conditions change, such as the maps in Figures 13-15. Moreover, the model provides insights on the formula of MASI, the similarity/difference between MASI and DP, and the possibility of both monomolecular and bi-molecular deactivation routes. One may refer to the explanatory paragraphs of Table 1 for more details.

The model was not developed to cover all possible conditions. Without limits on conditions, the model would project that the deactivation rate will continue to decrease monotonically as H2/C4H10 decreases. However, severe deactivation would certainly occur when there is no H2 in the reaction gas. The model is most accurate when H2/C4H10 ≥ 1. Although reducing H2/C4H10 to below one can continuously decelerate deactivation to some extent, further decreasing H2/C4H10 would reverse the trend. As is shown in Figure 16A, at 548 K and 7.9 bar, the deactivation rate kept decreasing as H2/C4H10 dropped from 1.01 to 0.58. Once the H2/C4H10 went below 0.58, the deactivation started to accelerate. It is noteworthy that the deactivation was still at a moderate rate when the H2/C4H10 was as low as 0.15. Similarly, at 583 K (Figure 16B), the deactivation rate kept dropping until H2/C4H10 reached 0.65. The deactivation started to rise with further decreasing H2/C4H10. The deactivation rate remained moderate at H2/C4H10 = 0.51, but accelerated substantially as H2/C4H10 went down to 0.38 and to 0.15.
As stated above, the most desirable condition to mitigate catalyst deactivation is hydrogen-lean (below the reaction stoichiometry). The single-bed butane conversion is hence limited. Additional reactors need to be sequenced to raise the overall butane conversion. It should also be noted that the ethane selectivity, as projected by the LH kinetic model8, decays as H2/C4H10 decreases (Figure 17). However, the loss of ethane selectivity can be effectively recovered by inter-stage H2 addition in a multiple-reactor setup. Such a setup is separately addressed in an invention disclosure14.

[bookmark: _Toc30599732]Conclusions and future works
The deactivation of an Ir-Pt catalyst in butane hydrogenolysis follows a unique trend, where it can be more stable in hydrogen-lean conditions than hydrogen-rich ones. Such a counter-intuitive phenomenon can be modeled and explained by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood deactivation model based on reasonably hypothesized surface reactions. The model aligned aligns well with the experimental results in differential reactors.
Compared to the previously used benchmark testing conditions, hydrogen-lean conditions can significantly extend the catalyst lifetime at a higher rate of reaction. The learnings from the this novel model can substantially shorten reactor downtime, shrink the reactor size to achieve the same production rate, and reduce the cost of separating H2.
[bookmark: _GoBack]The model will be used to align with the existing pilot data and provide guidelines for future piloting trials.

Project:	Butane Hydrocracking – Pathway to Enhanced Ethylene Production
Author:	Robert Broekhuis

executive summary
A previously developed kinetic and reactor model for butane hydrocracking were used to investigate conditions and reactor configurations that promote high propane production from a field butane stream. Condition and configuration choices include the ratio of hydrogen to butane in the reactor feed, the number of adiabatic hydrocracking reactors, as well as the size and inlet temperature of each reactor. The best trade-off between selectivity to propane and fractional conversion of butane was found at the lowest H2:C4 ratios. One promising four-reactor configuration can deliver (according to the model) 91.9% selectivity at 84.4% conversion, with an additional 4.9% selectivity to ethane. The impact of design and condition choices on capital, raw material costs, and other operating costs can be determined in a more detailed techno-economic analysis, in the context of which these models can provide further guidance on reactor performance and design.




Background
A study of opportunities for C4 utilization in SABIC’s assets in Saudi Arabia has identified a scenario at the Saudi Kayan complex at Al Jubail that would benefit from a high level of propane production from a butanes feed stream. Earlier C4 utilization scenarios revolved around maximizing ethane production; in these cases, the hydrogenolysis reaction process was identified as the best technical and economic fit. However, hydrogenolysis of butanes does not produce much propane, so the alternative process using hydrocracking reactions appears more suitable for this newly identified scenario.
A kinetic model for reaction occurring across SABIC’s bifunctional hydrocracking catalyst (Pt/ZSM-5) was developed in 2018 based on a large number of data points from isothermal reactor experiments. When integrated into a reactor model, this model can predict the performance of a sequence of adiabatic reactors, in terms of conversion and selectivities. Various reactor configurations and operating conditions were probed to find ones that produce a high propane yield from a mixed butanes feed. The results below illustrate promising combinations of parameters, and highlight the trade-off between butane conversion and selectivity to propane.
Kinetic Model
The kinetic model underlying this case study was built based on several hundred data points collected in isothermal laboratory reactors, with feeds including n-butane, mixed butanes, propane, and hydrocarbon blends including methane and ethane. Temperatures varied from 370-500°C. Space velocities were in most cases selected to result in close to differential conversion (butane conversion <20%), but experimental series varying space velocity from differential to high conversion were also among the data set. The experiments were analyzed in the context of various proposed reaction networks, each of which was analyzed by custom parameter fitting programs developed in Matlab. This procedure was complicated to some extent by the fact that, while hydrocracking is known to proceed through the formation of various adducts and oligomers, most of these intermediates could not be detected in the reactor effluent. Therefore, the reactions in the reaction network were formulated as lumped reactions, not corresponding to a particular reaction mechanism, but selected based on feasibility to produce the overall stoichiometry from likely microkinetic mechanisms. While none of the networks was able to explain the detailed results from all experiments, a network and kinetic parameter set was selected that successfully reproduced trends of conversion and selectivity, especially among the experiments most relevant to the envisioned technical implementation.  The detailed description of the kinetic experiments and model development will be reported separately.
The selected reaction network is represented by the reaction steps below:
1. C3H8 ⇄ C3H6 + H2 
2. n-C4H10 ⇄ n-C4H8 + H2 
3. i-C4H10 ⇄ i-C4H8 + H2 
4. C5H12 ⇄ C5H10 + H2 
5. 2 n-C4H8 ⇄ C3H6 + C5H10 
6. n-C4H8 + i-C4H8 ⇄ C3H6 + C5H10 
7. 2 i-C4H8 ⇄ C3H6 + C5H10 
8. n-C4H8  + C5H10 ⇄ 3 C3H6 
9. 2 C3H6 + 2 H2  → n-C4H10 + C2H6 
10. 2 C3H6 + 3 H2  → 3 C2H6 
11. n-C4H10 + H2 → C3H8 + CH4 
12. i-C4H10 + H2 → C3H8 + CH4
13. C3H8 + H2 → C2H6 + CH4
14. C5H12 + H2 → C3H8 + C2H6
15. n-C4H10 ⇄ i-C4H10 
16. C3H6 + C4H8 → C7H8 + 3 H2 
The reactions in this network fall into several blocks:
Equations 1-4 represent reversible dehydrogenation reactions; these reactions produce the olefins that participate in the reactions of the second block, and convert the resulting smaller olefins to paraffin products. 
Equations 5-8 represent reshuffling of olefins through reversible oligomerization and beta-scission reactions. Only C3+ species participate in these reactions, which were chosen to allow interconversion between C3 and the two C4s in any proportions.
Equations 9 and 10 represent the effect of consecutive reactions in which propylene dimerizes followed by protolytic cracking. These irreversible reactions are responsible for most of the conversion of C3 to C2 in the latter half of the reactor.
Equations 11-14 represent the irreversible direct protolytic cracking of C3-C5 alkanes.
Finally, equation 15 is the reversible isomerization between normal- and iso-butane, and equation 16 represents the irreversible formation of aromatic species (lumped as toluene) from olefin intermediates.
An important feature of this network is that the reversible reactions only interconvert between C3 and C4 species (pentanes are not a significant end product), while all formation of methane and ethane proceeds via irreversible reactions. The reversible reactions are less thermally activated than the irreversible ones, so that the latter are favored at higher temperatures, and to some extent by higher hydrogen partial pressures. The thermodynamics describing the reversible reactions (equilibrium constants and heats of reaction) were described in the model a priori, based on studies conducted with Aspen, so the model results cannot violate thermodynamic equilibrium.
Reactor Model
As an extension of the kinetic model development, a reactor model was also implemented in Matlab. While the model allows non-adiabatic conditions (used to describe pilot reactor experiments), for this study the reactors were assumed to be adiabatic, in a strictly plug flow pattern with pseudo-homogeneous kinetics. Hence, the reactor model simply integrates along the catalyst bed, adjusting compositions according to the kinetics from the reaction network, and adjusting temperature according to heats of reaction and heat capacity of the flowing reactants. The model allows an arbitrary number of reactors in series to be modeled, each with its own inlet temperature (corresponding to a reactor sequence with interstage cooling). Each reactor can be sized independently, so the overall train of reactors is described

by the sequence of invidual-reactor space velocities, from which the overall space velocity can be calculated:

Hence, the parameter set for any particular simulation is defined by:
· Number of reactors in series
· Space velocities for each of the reactors
· Inlet temperatures for each of the reactors
· Feed composition (expressed as H2:C4 ratio, where C4 is a 70:30 mixture of iso and normal)
Reactor model results include, in principle, the full detail of individual reaction rates, compositions, and temperatures as they vary along the sequence of reactors. They are most conveniently visualized in a plot like the one shown in Figure 1.
Visual inspection of such a plot establishes the “reasonableness” of a particular configuration. For example, the result in Figure 1 is judged to be reasonable because the temperature profiles through the reactors do not show undue excursions, and there is a clear progression of conversion through each of the reactors. For reasonable cases, the quantitative results can be extracted and tabulated: butane conversion, selectivities towards methane, ethane, propane, and BTX.


From experimental results obtained from laboratory and piloting experiments, including the ones described in previous reports (Dasari, Hooks, and Fickel, 2017; Broekhuis, 2019), it is well established that even in experiments aimed at producing primarily ethane, the conversion of butanes proceeds largely through propane as an intermediate product, with ethane production ramping up at higher temperatures and longer catalyst exposure. Therefore, conditions producing maximum propane yield are likely to occur at higher overall space velocity and relatively low temperature. This was confirmed by preliminary optimization by statistical means performed by Prasanna Dasari, using the results from an early process optimization study as interpreted by JMP statistical software. The optimum she identified also occurred at low H2:C4 ratio. This analysis guided the selection of conditions to explore in the current modeling study.
The results presented here were generated using sequences of three or four reactors. An even larger number of reactors may produce marginally better results due to the availability of additional degrees of freedom, but the comparison between three- and four-reactor cases suggests that further improvement potential is small.
The number of simulation parameters presented in the previous section is somewhat large, and many combinations of parameters are not feasible (i.e., would result in meaningless model results). Furthermore, at the time this study was conducted, the objective function could not be unambiguously defined: propane yield (conversion times selectivity) could be optimized, but for overall economics selectivity is likely more important than conversion, while among the non-propane products, selectivity to ethane is preferable to methane. This would require a more nuanced objective function to be defined. For these reasons, no attempt was made to algorithmically optimize within the parameter space. Instead, reasonable solutions were constructed by visual inspection of profile plots. As is usually the case, the desired product selectivity decreases with conversion in the region of optimal performance. Hence, the parameters were adjusted to probe both solutions with relatively high selectivity and lower conversion and those that maximized conversion at the expense of selectivity.
Four levels of H2:C4 were considered: 0.4 (the level suggested by Prasanna’s preliminary optimization), 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Figure 2 shows the results of all reasonable cases simulated, on a plot of propane carbon molar selectivity vs. fractional butane conversion. 
Figure 2 reveals some interesting trends: for all H2:C4 ratios, there appears to be a knee in the curve of achievable selectivity vs. conversion. Below a certain conversion, additional conversion can be gained easily, without giving up much selectivity – but after a breakpoint (which varies with H2:C4 ratio), additional conversion is only gained at a much greater cost to selectivity. This must be due to inherent limitations in the chemistry and thermodynamics; to explore these limitations, a study of stoichiometry and equilibrium was done using Aspen Plus, the results of which are provided in Figure 3. Although the study was conducted for all four ratios, only the results for H2:C4=0.5 are shown for clarity.
The figure shows four curves/lines, each terminating at the same point for 100% selectivity. This point represents the equilibrium conversion for hydrocracking of butanes to propane (in this case, calculated at 400°C), and thus defines the maximum achievable conversion for a catalyst that is perfectly selective towards propane. The two dashed curves also represent equilibrium compositions, for cases where the propane-butane equilibrium is attained alongside some (irreversible) conversion of butanes to methane (left curve) or ethane (right curve).

These curves illustrate how, when non-selective reactions (which of course lower the selectivity) consume hydrogen, the butane conversion can also decrease. As a large fraction of the hydrogen in the feed is consumed by the irreversible reactions, the equilibrium compositions also include increasing amounts of unsaturates. At very low space velocity, all exit conversions must fall between the two dashed curves (for a situation in which methane, ethane, and propane are the only products). At lower space velocities, it is in principle possible to freeze the composition outside of the equilibrium area. For example, following the establishment of C3-C4 equilibrium, conversion of butanes could theoretically proceed according to the irreversible reactions. Regardless of whether methane or ethane is formed, this process is represented by the top solid curve; as expected, this curve occurs along a path of constant yield, marching towards higher conversions while sacrificing selectivity. The trajectory of re-equilibrating the C3/C4 reaction of resulting compositions is shown by the dashed black lines: both butane conversion and propane selectivity decrease. Much worse, of course, is the case in which it is propane that is irreversibly converted to methane and/or ethane, represented by the vertical solid line: selectivity decreases at constant butane conversion.
This analysis implies that the maximum yield of propane that can be attained is the one corresponding to the equilibrium at 100% selectivity, and that any attempts to increase butanes conversion beyond this point reduce both yield and selectivity, quite steeply. The equilibrium point of course depends on temperature, and shifts towards higher conversions at lower temperature. This means that the best yields and selectivities would be attained by operating at low temperature and low space velocity, to approach equilibrium without activating the irreversible reactions. 
The situation looks somewhat different for C4:H2=1, shown in Figure 4 for 415°C. In this case, conversion of butane to ethane is not limited by the hydrogen supply, so that the equilibrium branch extends rightward toward full conversion. The higher hydrogen concentration results in a more favorable butane/propane equilibrium, and therefore higher maximum selectivity. On the other hand, the reversible reactions, which proceed through olefins, are slower, while the irreversible ones, which are favored by hydrogen, are faster, so that the actual results do not approach the optimum selectivity as closely: non-selective reactions are relatively more prominent even at mild conditions. Therefore, while the results when attempting to push conversion beyond the optimum are limited in similar ways as at the lower hydrogen level, the results at lower conversion are characterized by a lower selectivity plateau. Attempts to achieve higher selectivities by decreasing space velocity and operating at low temperature were largely unsuccessful.
The H2:C4 ratio is clearly among the critical parameters. Lower ratios promote the dehydrogenation of butanes, to yield the olefins from which all propane production reactions proceed, while hydrogenolysis reactions are suppressed. Thus, lower ratios give rise to smaller reactors and better selectivity to propane. Ultimately, the ratio is limited by stoichiometry. The desired overall reaction is:
3 C4H10 + H2 → 4 C3H8
which requires a H2:C4 ratio of 0.33 to proceed to completion. In reality, the reaction does not proceed to completion, but the formation of methane and ethane products consumes greater amounts of hydrogen. Too large a depletion of hydrogen, even in transient situations (e.g., incipient runaway), may result in undesired chemistry and catalyst deactivation, so the ratio should be selected with some margin of safety.
If H2:C4 ratios between 0.5 and 1.0 are considered acceptable, the results in Figure 1 provide some guidance on conditions to select for optimum propane production. First, a suitable trade-off between selectivity and conversion must be decided on. Since unconverted butanes can be recycled in the process, it seems reasonable that selectivity is more important than conversion, so the propane yield (the product of the two) is not the best objective function. On the other hand, separation, compression, and capital costs will increase as conversion decreases, so conversion must be considered as well. Somewhat arbitrarily, we might decide to maximize  . To visually gauge the simulation results against this objective, curves of constant values of X are shown in Figure 1. As expected, the highest values are obtained at the lowest value of H2:C4: for a ratio of 0.5, the optimum is represented by the point at 83.5% conversion and 92% C3 selectivity; conversion may be sacrificed in favor of selectivity without much of a decrease in X. At higher ratios, the curves defined by the model points more closely parallel the iso-X curves, so there is a wide latitude in selecting conversion. For example, 85% conversion may be selected to achieve around 81% selectivity, or 81% conversion for around 84% selectivity.
One aspect not evident from the plots is the distribution of the non-propane selectivities. At a ratio of 0.5, methane and ethane selectivities are 2.6% and 4.9%, respectively; at a ratio of 1.0, they are 6.6% and 12%, respectively. While the ratio of C1:C2 selectivities for these cases is similar, the absolute loss of chemical value to fuel gas methane is obviously greater at the higher ratio. Also of potential interest is the production of aromatics, which are represented in the model as toluene. In the kinetic model development effort, it was found that the model fidelity for aromatics formation trends was markedly lower than for the primary products, but qualitative trends in the predictions are likely correct. For the cases presented in Figure 1, toluene selectivities (on carbon molar basis) ranged from very low to as high as 2%; not surprisingly, the higher numbers were predicted for cases with low H2:C4 combined with high outlet temperature – conditions typically encountered when trying to push conversion beyond the knee point in the plot. When the temperature was kept at lower levels (<405°C for H2:C4=0.5, or <415°C for H2:C4=1), toluene selectivities were always below 1%; typical values were around 0.6% for the lower ratio, and 0.4% for the higher one.



Preliminary Optimum Result
It is possible that other considerations, not evident from reactor modeling, pose a lower limit on H2:C4. For example, catalyst deactivation may be more rapid as the ratio decreases.  However, in the absence of such considerations, operation at low H2:C4 appears to give the best results. For purposes of initial techno-economic scoping, the reactor configuration giving rise to the best result obtained in this study (for ratio not below 0.5) is described below. This result was chosen without regard to capital cost considerations. Other configurations can be readily defined that give rise to only slightly reduced performance at higher space velocity (i.e., smaller reactor size) or lower number of reactors. This is subject to more detailed techno-economic analysis, which this reactor model can support as it is undertaken.

n/ZSM-5

. Introduction

In the era of high gasoline prices, the importance of fluid cat-
lytic cracking (FCC) process that produces gasoline from vacuum
as oil and vacuum residue has increased last several decades.
ccordingly, the generation of by-products which contain a large
mount of olefins has also increased. Although olefins could be eas-
ly converted to paraffins by hydrogenation process, an excessive
mount of hydrogen is consumed and the demand for the pro-
uced paraffins is limited. In addition, tightening regulations on
lefin contents in reformulated gasoline in the near future requires
ew solutions. Aromatization could be one of the most effective
nd economical solutions to upgrade the low-value by-products
btained from FCC to higher value chemicals. Aromatization of
ropane has been already investigated for several decades and
n/ZSM-5 has been found to be one of the most effective catalysts
1].  In aromatization of paraffins including propane, the rate deter-

ining step is dehydrogenation reaction which converts alkanes
o corresponding alkenes of much higher reactivity [2,3]. Therefore,
he olefin-rich FCC by-product gives us a new opportunity as a more
ffective feedstock of aromatization. Nevertheless, commercializa-

ion of olefin aromatization process still poses a great challenge
ecause too high a reactivity of olefin in the feedstock deactivates
he catalyst quickly by coke formation.

Various attempts have been made to overcome the limitation
of this catalyst, i.e. short lifetime due to coke formation. Steam
treatment, a well-known method to control the acidity of zeolites,
was  proved as an effective way to prolong the lifetime of catalyst
in this reaction by several research groups. Thus, dealumination
of H-ZSM-5 by steaming prolonged the lifetime of the catalyst in
aromatization of acetone/n-butanol mixtures [4]. The alpha process
was  successfully developed and commercialized by Asahi/Sanyo
with both hydrothermally treated Zn/ZSM-5 extruded with alu-
mina as binder and a swing bed operation system [5].  The steam
treatment made the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst more stable, compared with
K-loaded ZSM-5 in butene aromatization [6].  The improved sta-
bility was attributed to the altered distribution of acidity during
hydrothermal process. An interesting method recently reported
by Bauer et al. used pre-coking and post-modification procedures
with hydrogen and alkanes to effectively passivate the acid sites
on the external surface of ZSM-5 selectively, which resulted in the
enhanced stability of catalyst as well as increased selectivity to
para-xylene [7–9]. In aromatization, the effect of oxidative regen-
eration by air on the distribution of acidity was reported in detail by
Tagliabue et al. [10]. Their FTIR results showed that the distribution
of acid sites changed and their concentration decreased at the same
time. In another report, oxidative regeneration also decreased the
concentration of acid sites when applied to the low Si/Al zeolites

[11].

Judging from these previous results, we  conjectured that the
lifetime of the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst could be improved by careful
control of the regeneration conditions. Thus in the present study,

e modified the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst by pre-coking and post treat-
ent under oxidative conditions with various concentrations of O2.

ince usual FCC byproducts are made of branched hydrocarbons, we
elected 2-methyl-2-butene as the model compound representing
CC olefins. The carefully modified catalyst exhibited enhanced sta-
ility in aromatization of 2-methyl-2-butene. The concentration of
xygen in the regeneration gas played a vital role in determining
erformance of the modified catalyst in this reaction. In addition,
e attempted to elucidate the effect of oxidative regeneration on

he acid property of the zeolite and its relationship with catalytic
ctivity and stability of the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst in the aromatization.
he proposed new dealumination method is simpler and easier to
ontrol (by changing oxygen concentration only) in comparison
ith conventional methods such as steaming or acid treatment.

. Experimental

.1. Materials

NH4-ZSM-5(HSZ-860NHA) obtained from Tosoh with Si/Al ratio
f 34 was used as a parent catalyst. The catalyst was loaded with

 wt% of Zn by incipient wetness impregnation by using a solu-
ion of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich, 98%). The impregnated catalyst
as dried at 353 K overnight and then calcined at 823 K in flowing

ir for 5 h under atmosphere pressure. The prepared catalyst was
elletized, crushed and sieved into 20/30 mesh for the reaction and
egeneration under various conditions.

.2. Pre-coking and oxidative regeneration

Pre-coking was carried out at 773 K and 0.5 MPa  for 26 h using 2-
ethyl-2-butene (95%, Aldrich) as a coking agent at WHSV = 7 h−1

nd high purity N2 gas as a carrier gas. After the pre-coking, high
urity N2 gas was continuously flown for 1 h to flush out the resid-
al pre-coking agents and some remained hydrocarbons inside the
eactor. To elucidate the effect of O2 concentration in the regen-
ration gas on the activity of the catalyst, the fully deactivated
atalyst was regenerated under the flow of 10% O2/N2, 50% O2/N2
nd 100% O2 for 24 h, which were denoted as 10% O2REG, 50%
2REG and 100% O2REG, respectively. The profile of temperature

ise was recorded during this step. Finally, prior to the reaction,
emained O2 in the reactor was removed by flowing high purity N2
or 1 h.

.3. Characterization

Temperature profiles were recorded by using Handycam of Sony
uring the regeneration. The temperature reading of the tempera-
ure controller was recorded as video and the values of every second
ere plotted manually. XRD patterns were recorded in the beam-

ine 8C2 HRPD at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Pohang,
orea. The incident X-rays were vertically collimated by a mirror,
nd monochromatized to the wavelength of 1.54960 Å by a double-
rystal Si(1 1 1) monochromator. A data set was collected from 5◦

o 50◦ with a step size of 0.01◦. The unit cell dimensions of each
ample were calculated. The 27Al MAS  NMR  experiments were car-
ied out to elucidate the effect of regeneration on dealumination
y using a Varian Unity Inova 600 (14.1T) with a 2.5 mm zirconia
otor at 20 kHz of spinning rate. The same amount of each sample
as employed.

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was
arried out to probe the distribution of acidity in the catalyst. The

xperimental procedure for TPD is as follows: at first, the temper-
ture of each catalyst (0.1 g) loaded on the U-shape quartz reactor
as increased from room temperature to 823 K at a rate of 10 K/min,

nd maintained for 1 h to remove the physisorbed water. And then,
ay 178 (2011) 72– 78 73

the temperature was lowered to 393 K and subsequently 1%NH3/He
gas was introduced into the reactor for adsorption of NH3 for 12 h.
Since ammonia does not physisorb at 393 K, all adsorbed ammonia
is chemisorbed one. Finally, TPD of NH3 proceeded by increasing
the temperature to 1073 K at 10 K/min and mass number (m/e−)
of 16(NH2) was recorded by a mass spectrometer HP5973MSD.
The amount of acid sites was  estimated by absorption of desor-
ped NH3 in diluted H2SO4 solution and then back titration with a
NaOH solution.

The FTIR analysis was  performed by using Perkin Elmer Spec-
trum 2000 Explorer to estimate the concentration of Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites. For the analysis, each sample of 15 mg  was  used
to prepare self-supporting zeolite disks of 13 mm  in diameter. Each
disk was  evacuated at 823 K for 2 h under 3.3 × 10−5 Torr and then
cooled to 423 K to record baseline. Pyridine was introduced to the
IR cell equipped with KBr windows for 1 min. Prior to FTIR mea-
surement, the pyridine-adsorbed sample was evacuated at 473 K
for 1 h and then cooled down to 423 K to rule out the tempera-
ture effect on the intensity and the half-width of the IR maxima
[12]. The spectrum was  recorded with 64 scans at a resolution of
4 cm−1 from 4000 to 1300 cm−1. This procedure was repeated at
573, 673 and 773 K to estimate the distribution of acidity for each
sample. For quantitative analysis, Beer–Lambert law was  used [13].
The HSZ-860NHA and the fresh samples were used as standards.
The absorption coefficients for Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (εB and
εL) were estimated to be 0.59 and 1.44 cm �mol−1, respectively. The
acid strength distribution was calculated by difference in peak areas
between a higher temperature spectrum and a lower tempera-
ture spectrum as follows: weak = A473 − A573, medium = A573 − A673,
strong = A673 − A773 and very strong = A773.

2.4. Catalytic reaction

The 2 wt%Zn/NH4-ZSM-5 catalyst (0.5 g) was loaded into the
stainless steel reactor with an inside diameter of 1.1 cm equipped
with a thermowell to measure and control the temperature at the
center of catalyst bed. Aromatization of 2-methyl-2-butene was
performed at 773 K, WHSV = 7 h−1, and 0.5 MPa. The 2-methyl-2-
butene (Aldrich, 95% purity reagent) feed was supplied by a double
plunge HPLC pump (Waters 1525). All the products were ana-
lyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (HP6890 GC) equipped
with an FID detector and HP PONA (50 m × 0.2 mm × 0.5�m)  cap-
illary column every 100 min  automatically. The effluent lines were
maintained at 473 K to prevent condensation of the products.

3. Results

3.1. Physical characterization of catalysts

In the present study, we  modified the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst by pre-
coking and post oxidative regeneration treatment to improve its
stability. It was  found that the concentration of oxygen in the regen-
eration gas played a vital role in determining performance of the
modified catalyst in this reaction. To understand what happened
during the regeneration process, the temperature profile of the
reactor was recorded at different O2 concentrations. Since the com-
bustion of the coke is an exothermic reaction, reactor temperature
increases with time by the generated heat. As shown in Fig. 1, the
concentration of O2 had a great effect on the temperature change.
In the case of 100% O2 regeneration, the maximum temperature of
987.3 K was recorded in 21 s while with 10% O2/N2, the tempera-

ture of catalyst bed increased slowly for 100 s to 810.2 K. It took
26 s to reach 949.0 K when 50% O2/N2 was  used as a regeneration
gas. Thus, the higher concentration of O2 provides more heat and
is expected to have more serious impact on the catalyst.

The crystal structure of the catalysts remained unchanged dur-

lightly changed. Table 1 shows decrease in the unit cell volume
f the samples treated with the regeneration gas of various oxy-
en concentrations. The order of unit cell volume was  as follows:
resh > 10% O2REG > 50% O2REG > 100% O2REG. This change could
e rationalized by loss of framework aluminum from the zeolite by

eat generated from burning the coke in the catalysts. The length of

also contract depending on the degree of dealumination. This was
also confirmed by 27Al MAS  NMR  discussed below.

The 27Al MAS  NMR  spectra in Fig. 3 show that all Al in the fresh
sample is tetrahedrally coordinated, but all regenerated samples
show a new peak around 0 ppm due to octahedrally coordinated
Al. Thus, heat of combustion during regeneration results in extrac-
tion of the framework Al to generate octahedrally coordinated Al
species out of the zeolite framework. Again, the concentration of
oxygen in the regeneration gas had great effects on the state of
aluminum species. In the case of 10% O2REG, the peak intensity at
around 54 ppm decreased and the new peak at 0 ppm appeared.
Under the more severe regeneration condition of 50% O2REG, the
intensity of 54 ppm was further reduced and the peak shape also
became asymmetrical, implying the presence of five-coordinated
AlO5 units. Finally, regeneration with pure oxygen resulted in the
further removal of the framework Al. Our 27Al MAS  NMR results are
well consistent with FTIR data reported earlier [10].

3.2. Acid properties of modified catalysts
To probe the acid properties of the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst, the cat-
alyst itself was first analyzed by FTIR. Silanol group of Si–OH is
distinguished from the acidic OH group of Si–OH–Al. As shown
in Fig. 4, silanol group and acidic Si–OH–Al appeared in all

amples at 3744 and 3607 cm−1, respectively [14]. The fresh sample
howed a well developed peak at 3607 cm−1 and a relatively small
eak of 3744 cm−1, whereas regenerated samples showed that the
eak intensity of acidic Si–OH–Al at 3607 cm−1 was  reduced while
he silanol peak at 3744 cm−1 became relatively more pronounced.
s the concentration of O2 increased, this tendency became more
ronounced and eventually only a little peak of acidic OH group
as observed in the 100% O2 REG sample. Because a tetrahedrally

oordinated framework Al in the zeolite can generate a maximum
f 4 silanol groups by dislodgement of Al–O bonding, the increase
f Si–OH bond indicates decreased concentration of Brønsted acid
ites.

The TPD of ammonia is most common and simplest technique
o investigate the general acid properties of solid acids. The results
f ammonia TPD in Fig. 5 and Table 2 indicate that regeneration
rocess dramatically change the acid properties of the Zn/ZSM-5
atalysts. The fresh catalyst showed two peaks at 522 K and 657 K.
n 10% O2REG sample, the TPD peak area representing total number
f acidic sites was reduced by about 11% and the intensity of high

emperature peak at 573–773 K was relatively more affected. In 50%
2REG sample, the amount of acid sites was further decreased by
round 17% and especially the very high temperature peak in the

atalyst had the most acid sites composed mainly of ‘strong’ and
very strong’ Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. After regeneration, the

strength of all Brønsted acid sites was reduced and in particular,
strong and very strong Brønsted acid sites disappeared. Simulta-
neously, the number of Lewis acid sites and L/B ratio increased
with increasing O2 concentration, suggesting that the newly gen-
erated octahedrally coordinated Al species detected by 27Al MAS
NMR played a role of Lewis acid sites of medium to strong strength
as listed in Table 3 and Fig. 6. Similar to these results, Occelli et al.
also reported decrease in the acidity of FCC catalyst after regener-
ation by using ammonia and pyridine as probe molecules with the
microcalorimetry technique [16]. Judging from our pyridine FTIR
results, we  can conclude that Brønsted acid sites are more affected
than Lewis acid sites by the regeneration process.

3.3. Aromatization of 2-methyl-2-butene

In Fig. 7, the conversion of 2-methyl-2-butene and the yields of
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEX) are dis-
played against time on stream (TOS). The conversion on the fresh
catalyst decreased slowly during the first 12 h of TOS, the catalyst
deactivated rapidly after then, and most of the activity was lost
after 26 h of TOS. The sample prepared by pre-coking and regen-
eration with 10% O2/N2 showed substantially improved stability
and the rapid deactivation started only after 26 h of TOS. The high-

est stability was  observed for 50% O2/N2REG catalyst showing no
sudden rapid deactivation. The 100% O2REG catalyst showed low
activity from the beginning of the reaction. The BTEX yield also
showed the similar trend to 2-methyl-2-butene conversion. Thus,

the major products of C11 aromatics. The C12 products were made
up of dimethylnaphthalene isomers. These hydrocarbons were
identified by GC/MS (HP5973MSD). The yields of each product were
plotted with TOS in Fig. 9. Although concentration of naphthalene
derivatives in C10–C12 was so small that the data showed some fluc-
tuations, the yield was typically decreased with TOS. However, the
yield of C9 aromatics increased with TOS and reached a maximum
point, which indicated that the C9 aromatics were intermediate of
C10–C12 aromatics. The reduced concentration of acid sites by the
pre-coking and regeneration treatment suppressed the conversion
of C9 to C10–C12 which could act as coke precursor. As a result, the
improved stability was  achieved through the treatment.

4. Discussion

In the present study, we  modified the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst by pre-
coking and post treatment under oxidative conditions to improve
its stability in aromatization of 2-methyl-2-butene. The concen-
tration of oxygen in the regeneration gas played a vital role in
determining performance of the modified catalyst in this reaction.
The oxidative regeneration caused dealumination from the zeo-
lite framework and tuned its acid property, which in turn modified
activity and stability of the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst in the aromatization.

The changes in structure and acid properties during the regener-
ation treatment have been confirmed. Thus, the contraction of unit
cell volume from 5376.08 Å3 to 5364.95, 5358.98 and 5352.33 Å3

was  revealed with synchrotron XRD. In 27Al MAS  NMR, the decrease
in the peak intensity at 54 ppm and concomitant generation
of a new peak at about 0 ppm indicated that the tetrahedrally
coordinated framework Al was  transformed to penta-coordinated
nonframework Al or octahedrally coordinated extraframework Al.
The FTIR analysis showed increase in silanol peak at 3744 cm−1and
decrease in acidic Si–OH–Al peak at 3607 cm−1. All these results
indicate thermal dealumination during the oxidative regeneration,
the degree of which depended critically on the concentration of O2.
As a result, the distribution of acidity of catalyst is modified, which
changes the initial composition of products as well as the lifetime
of catalyst.

In catalysis by zeolites, their acidity plays the key role in all
reactions of hydrocarbons. Aromatization has also been extensively
studied [2,17–19], and the current understanding on its reaction
pathway could be summarized as in Scheme 1. Oligomerization and
cyclization take place on Brønsted acid sites while Lewis acid sites
promote dehydrogenation of generated naphthenes. Because the
coke, responsible for deactivation, is mainly deposited on Brønsted
acid sites, their role is most important.

Desired reactions of oligomerization and cyclization as well as
and coke formation are all catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites but
each reaction has its own  favorable strength of Brønsted acid sites
[20]. It is well established that coke formation generally takes place

pathways of aromatization.

n strong Brønsted acid sites while oligomerization and cycliza-
ion occurs on weaker Brønsted acid sites [21]. Thus, for successful
romatization with high stability and high yield of BTEX, appropri-
te modification of the distribution of Brønsted acid sites is most
mportant. In the fresh catalyst, there were too many ‘strong’ and
very strong’ Brønsted acid sites of 0.154 mmol/g. It was reduced
o 0.117, 0.097 and 0.024 mmol/g after 10% O2REG, 50% O2REG
nd 100% O2REG, respectively, which resulted in suppressing the
eneration of monomolecular cracking products such as C1 and C2
nd the conversion of C9 to C10–C12, which are coke precursors.
lthough the number of weak and medium Brønsted acid sites was
lso reduced greatly after regeneration, the results showed that
.027 mmol/g in 50% O2REG was enough to produce oligomers and
yclic hydrocarbons. Therefore, elimination of unnecessary excess
strong’ and ‘very strong’ Brønsted acid sites can suppress the side
eactions and the rate of coke formation, which results in the
ncrease in the catalyst lifetime.

It is also well known that too high density of Brønsted acid sites
akes the catalyst deactivation fast [22]. In Fig. 7, the fresh catalyst

howed the fastest rate of deactivation for this reason. The total
oncentration of Brønsted acid sites decreased from 0.23 mmol/g
o 0.156, 0.124 and 0.043 mmol/g as listed in Table 2 upon oxida-
ive regeneration. The 50% O2REG catalyst showed the best stability

aintaining the same high activity although the density of Brønsted
cid sites was reduced by about half. However, this concentration
f Brønsted acid sites seems enough to catalyze this reaction. In
he case of 100% O2REG, the density of Brønsted acid sites was
ecreased by 80%, which is too small to promote the reaction. Thus,
he density of Brønsted acid sites could be controlled by adjust-
ng O2 concentration during the regeneration treatment so that the
atalyst lifetime is prolonged without sacrifice in its activity and
electivity.

. Conclusions

As a new method to control acidity of zeolite catalyst, pre-coking

nd oxidative regeneration have been demonstrated. Thermal dea-
umination preferentially modified the distribution and density
f the Brønsted acid sites. The concentration of O2 in regenera-
ion gas was found as the key factor. Partial removal of strong

Brønsted acid sites reduced the undesired side reactions leading to
coke formation. Thus, the lifetime of catalysts was  improved with-
out deteriorating activity and selectivity in the aromatization of
2-methyl-2-butene. The proposed new dealumination method is
simpler and easier to control (just by changing oxygen concentra-
tion) in comparison with conventional methods such as steaming
or acid treatment.

Thermal ageing of PE 100 pipes for accelerated lifetime prediction under service 
conditions

Author(s): H. Vogt, H-F. Enderle, U. Schulte  -  Basell Polyolefine GmbH

Abstract:
It is widely accepted that the maximum lifetime of pipes made from bimodal HDPE types 
have reached a stage of development at which the service lifetime of the material is limited 
only by its resistance against thermal aging. The time until this degradation starts depends
mainly on the stabilization package, the applied temperature, the oxygen concentration and 
the type and the flow rate of the media. However, a simple and fast method of determining the 
long term stability of HDPE pipes under service conditions is desirable. 

The resistance to thermal degradation was studied on pipes made from a PE 100 resin
containing a usual antioxidant system in different concentrations. To simulate service 
conditions the heat ageing was performed under internal pressure with circulating or stagnant 
water at elevated temperatures until brittle failures occurred. The progress in ageing was 
studied on samples taken from the installed pipes and changes in molecular structure and 
antioxidant concentration were determined. The activation energies were calculated using the 
Arrhenius equation as a function of the fracture times and compared with those obtained as a 
function of other parameters such as loss in OIT.

Introduction:
Since the introduction of plastic pipes made from polyethylene, suitable accelerating test 
methods were needed to predict the maximum service lifetime of those pipes under multi-
stress conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, fluid or thermal degradation). It was very early 
recognized that hydrostatic pressure tests on pipes at different internal stress load and 
temperatures can be used as a reliable and proven method to estimate the service lifetime 
either by graphical or today by mathematical extrapolation based on the Arrhenius-law. Those 
creep rupture curves of polyethylene pipes according to ISO 9080 indicate different failure 
modes: In stage I ductile fractures occur due to yielding, whereas in stage II brittle fractures 
are dominating, which are mainly related to slow crack growth. And stage III limits the 
lifetime of the pipes by the extreme brittleness of the degrading polymer even under low 
stress levels (figure1) [1].

The time until the thermo-oxidative degradation starts depends on the polymer, its additive 
package and the environmental conditions, e.g. the temperature, the applied stress, the 
leaching of the additives by the medium/fluid and the concentration of the oxidant. Therefore 
a simple and fast method of determining the long term ageing stability of HDPE pipes under 
service conditions is desirable which takes into account all of the components of long term 
stabilization and service conditions.

The test procedure is described in table 1. To accelerate the time to failure, PE 100 pipes 
(Dimension 32x3mm) produced with different additive levels were installed. The ageing 
resistance was investigated at different temperatures (80°C -110°C) with circulating water
inside and hot air outside, with weekly water change. The hydrostatic pipe pressure was only 
1 bar and 1.4 bar for T = 110°C respectively to simulate stage III mode as shown in figure 1.

Results
To date the pipe ageing has achieved more than 25.000 h. The brittle failures are listed in 
table 2. As expected, the brittle failures occurred previously at higher ageing temperatures and 
previously at lower additive levels in the pipes. By far the shortest ageing resistance had the 
non stabilized pipes. Picture 1 shows a pipe under test with this type of brittle failure.

The activation energy ΔH for the thermo-oxidative ageing of PE was calculated from the
fracture times using the Arrhenius equation:

 t1 and t2 are the failure times at temperature T1 and T2.

No significant difference in the activation energy ΔH ageing for stabilized and none stabilized 
pipes could be found. The ΔH ageing deduced from the slope was approximately 90 kJ/mol. It 
indicates that the degradation process for the stabilized and non stabilized pipes is the same. 
Furthermore, from pipe pressure tests performed in the presence of strong oxidants like Cl2
and nitric acid, similar activation energies ΔHAgeing of 96 and 94 kJ/mol respectively were 
obtained. That makes it plausible that the thermo-oxidative degradation process of PE follows
the same chemistry which is well understood [2]. When initiated the rate determent step might 
be either the formation of chain radicals via hydrogen abstraction or at least chain scission.
The more effective the stabilization, the better it retards the ageing process. The presence of 
strong oxidants such as O2, Cl2 or nitric acid accelerates the consumption of the additives and
therefore the degradation process starts earlier.

Additionally the progress in ageing was studied on samples cut of the installed pipes and 
changes in molecular structure (viscosity number, MFR) and additive concentration were 
determined. No significant changes in MFR close to the time to failure could be found. 
Therefore these properties do not allow a prediction of failure times. In contrast the OIT 
values drop very rapidly with the ageing time as shown in figure 4 for pipes with an additive 
level of 50%. The calculated activation energies ΔH for the OIT drop are only approximately 
50 kJ/mol. That’s obvious; otherwise the additives couldn’t retard the ageing process of the 
polymer.

Figure 4:    OIT drop as a function of ageing time for pipes with 50% AO level

                  
Yet it has to be considered that the loss of OIT is not an adequate method to describe the 
progress of ageing. In general the OIT drop can not be allocated to changes in the 



concentration of the present additives. Furthermore the changes in OIT during ageing can be
affected either by the leaching of the additives by the medium or by scavenging free radicals. 

As shown in picture 2 the degradation starts preferred at the internal pipe surface. That’s 
obvious because the circulating hot water leaches the additives from the surface and enhances 
the chemical attack by the oxygen. The embrittled layer of the internal pipe surface was 
identified by light microscopy to be about 20 % or 0.6 mm of the total wall thickness of 3 
mm. But this is only valid for the stabilized pipes!  Beside this the external surface of non 
stabilized pipes is more degraded than the internal surface as shown in picture 3. This may be 
due to the greater rate of oxidation on the external surface as more oxygen is available than at 
the internal surface of the pipe, which may explain the very short failure times of the non 
stabilized PE 100 pipes.

Picture 2:   Degradation of the internal pipe surface

Picture 3: Embrittlement of the external surface of non stabilized PE 100 pipes

• Strong degradation at the outer surface
• Minor degradation at the inner surface



It also indicates that at the internal surface of the stabilized pipes the leaching of the additives 
by the circulating hot water is predominating and the loss of the additives accelerates the 
ageing process. As in the non stabilized pipes no leaching of the additives at the internal 
surface can take place; the embrittlement of the external surface is inevitable due to the higher 
oxygen concentration in the air.

From this observation, it is understandable that the very short failure times of the non 
stabilized pipes do not fit within the linear correlation of those from the stabilized pipes as 
shown in figure 5. According to the linear regression the time to failure for the non stabilized
pipe should be around 5800 h at T =100°C and much longer as the 170 h, which have been the 
result of the ageing experiment.

A ΔHAgeing of 95 kJ/mol was calculated from the Arrhenius plot of the rate constants which 
resulted from the linear correlation of failure times at different aging temperatures versus 
additive level in the pipes. 

Summary:
Test equipment was developed to study the progress in ageing of PE 100 pipes at different 
temperatures and circulating water/ air mode. To accelerate the time to failure pipes with 
different additive levels were tested. It could be found that the activation energy ΔHAgeing is 
about 90 kJ/mol either for non stabilized or stabilized pipes. The key parameters for the time 
to failure are: ageing temperature, leaching of additives (flow rate of the water), additive 
package and level, concentration of the oxidant. Loss of OIT is not an adequate method to 
describe the progress of ageing.

Transition-State Enthalpy and Entropy Effects on Reactivity and
Selectivity in Hydrogenolysis of n‑Alkanes
David W. Flaherty and Enrique Iglesia*

Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States

*S Supporting Information

ABSTRACT: Statistical mechanics and transition state (TS)
theory describe rates and selectivities of C−C bond cleavage in
C2−C10 n-alkanes on metal catalysts and provide a general
description for the hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons. Mecha-
nistic interpretation shows the dominant role of entropy, over
enthalpy, in determining the location and rate of C−C bond
cleavage. Ir, Rh, and Pt clusters cleave C−C bonds at rates
proportional to coverages of intermediates derived by
removing 3−4 H-atoms from n-alkanes. Rate constants for
C−C cleavage reflect large activation enthalpies (ΔH⧧, 217−
257 kJ mol−1) that are independent of chain length and C−C bond location in C4+ n-alkanes. C−C bonds cleave because of large,
positive activation entropies (ΔS⧧, 164−259 J mol−1 K−1) provided by H2 that forms with TS. Kinetic and independent
spectroscopic evidence for the composition and structure of these TS give accurate estimates of ΔS⧧ for cleavage at each C−C
bond. Large differences between rate constants for ethane and n-decane (∼108) reflect an increase in the entropy of gaseous
alkanes retained at the TS. The location of C−C bond cleavage depends solely on the rotational entropies of alkyl chains
attached to the cleaved C−C bond, which depend on their chain length. Such entropy considerations account for the ubiquitous,
but previously unexplained, preference for cleaving nonterminal C−C bonds in n-alkanes. This mechanistic analysis and
thermodynamic treatment illustrates the continued utility of such approaches even for hydrogenolysis reactions, with complexity
seemingly beyond the reach of classical treatments, and applies to catalytic clusters beyond those reported here (0.6−2.7 nm;
Ir, Rh, Pt).

1. INTRODUCTION

The catalytic hydrogenolysis of alkanes, especially ethane, butane,
and substituted cyclopentanes, has been extensively studied1−9

since the initial reports of ethane hydrogenolysis on surfaces of
Fe and Ni clusters by Taylor et al.10−12 and the seminal findings
on ring-opening reactions of substituted cyclopentanes on Pt8,13

and Ir14 clusters by Gault et al.15 Hydrogenolysis of alkanes is
considered a prototypical structure-sensitive reaction, for which
turnover rates, activation energies, and the identity of adsorbed
and reactive species depend strongly on the identity16−20 and the
coordinative saturation of the atoms exposed at metal cluster
surfaces.2,8,15,21−27 The location of C−C bond cleavage in
alkanes depends on temperature (because of differences in
activation enthalpies), on H2 and alkane pressures, on the
identity of the catalytic metal, on the coordinative unsaturation
of exposed metals atoms, which varies with cluster size, and on
the substitution of the C-atoms at a given C−C bond.15,28−34
These effects determine the selectivity in reactions that cleave
C−C, C−S, and C−O bonds present in reactants derived from
fossil or biomass resources, for which catalytic processes improve
their energy density and fuel quality, while removing heteroatom
contaminants.3,34−38

Broad concepts and unifying principles that describe reactivity
and selectivity in catalytic hydrogenolysis have remained elusive;
in particular, as they seek connections between simpler

molecules, such as ethane, and molecules more relevant to
industrial practice, such as larger n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and
cycloalkanes. The large body of previous work does not provide
clear guidance about how kinetic effects of temperature, reactant
coverage, alkane and cycloalkane structure, and metal cluster size
or identity lead, in turn, to hydrogenolysis turnover rates and
C−C bond cleavage selectivities. Here, we seek such guidance for
hydrogenolysis of n-alkanes on Ir, Rh, and Pt clusters through
rigorous mechanistic interpretations of turnover rates and
selectivities using the formalism of transition state theory.
The sequence of elementary steps proposed here describes

n-alkane (C2−C10) hydrogenolysis rates, while providing
evidence for the extent of dehydrogenation of the intermediates
involved in the cleavage of specific C−C bonds. The resulting
rate equation contains equilibrium and rate constants for
elementary steps, which reflect the chemical origins of the
observed reactivity and concomitant differences between the
Gibbs free energy of the reactant alkane and adsorbed H-atoms
(H*) and that of the product H2, formed by desorbing 2H*
and dehydrogenating the alkane, and the kinetically relevant
transition state. Activation enthalpies (ΔH⧧) reflect homolytic
dissociation energies of C−C bonds in alkanes, and activation

entropies (ΔS⧧) depend, in part, on the entropy of transition
states that we predict using the principles of statistical
mechanics to describe a plausible transition-state structure.
These data and their mechanistic interpretation provide
evidence for the preeminent role of entropy in hydrogenolysis
catalysis, which allows reactions with large activation barriers to
proceed at modest temperatures. Identical series of elementary
steps lead to C−C bond rupture at every position in each
n-alkane, however, the statistical mechanics model predicts how
small changes in transition state structures lead to consequen-
tial entropy differences that ultimately determine the location
of C−C bond cleavage along the n-alkane backbone. We show
here that these concepts are general to hydrogenolysis rates and
selectivities of n-alkanes on surfaces of metal clusters and also
describe the hydrogenolysis of isoalkanes and cycloalkanes, as
we discuss in later reports.

2. METHODS AND CHARACTERIZATION RESULTS
2.1. Synthesis of Supported Ir, Rh, and Pt Catalysts. Silica

[Davisil 646, 300 m2 g−1] was treated in flowing dry air (Praxair,
99.99%, 5.0 cm3 g−1 s−1) by heating to 823 at 0.03 K s−1 and holding
for 5 h. Highly dispersed Ir complexes were deposited onto treated
silica using incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of
Ir complexes prepared by combining triethanolamine (TEA, Sigma-
Aldrich, 97%) with H2IrCl6 (Strem Chemicals, 99%) (20:1 mol) in
deionized (DI) water (17.9 MΩ resistivity), as reported previously for
Ru catalysts.39 Ir-SiO2 (1.0% wt) was prepared by adding H2IrCl6
(0.424 g) to deionized water (21.2 cm3) and then adding TEA (3.11 g).
The resulting purple H2IrCl6 suspension turned clear olive-green upon
TEA addition, consistent with replacement of Cl by TEA ligands. This
clear solution (24.7 g) was added dropwise to the treated SiO2 (20.0 g
of Davisil 646). Ir−SiO2 samples with different Ir loadings were
prepared by changing the concentration of TEA and H2IrCl6 while
maintaining a 20:1 mol ratio between these components. Rh−SiO2
(0.5% wt) was prepared by impregnating SiO2 (12.0 g of Davisil 646)
with a solution containing TEA (0.72 g) and Rh(NO3)3 (0.140 g,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) (10:1 mol) in DI water. Pt−SiO2 (1.0% wt) was
synthesized by strong-electrostatic adsorption of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2
(0.400 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) onto SiO2 (20.0 g Davisil 646) from
a 0.4 M NH4OH solution (200 mL).

40 The solution was stirred for 2 h
to allow cationic Pt complexes to adsorb. The solids were filtered and
rinsed three times with 100 mL of DI water. All metal-loaded silica
samples were heated to 393 at 0.017 K s−1 in flowing dry air and held
for 8 h. The resulting dry Ir−SiO2 and Rh−SiO2 powders were heated
to 573 at 0.017 K s−1 in flowing dry air and held for 1 h with the intent
to condense TEA complexes with silanol groups on silica surfaces.39

These samples were then heated to 673 at 0.033 K s−1 in flowing 50%
H2/He (Praxair, 99.999%, 1.0 cm

3 g−1 s−1) and held for 3 h to
decompose the precursors and form Ir and Rh metal clusters. The dry
Pt−SiO2 was heated to 723 at 0.017 K s

−1 in flowing 50% H2/He and
held for 3 h to form Pt clusters. Samples were cooled to ambient

temperature and passivated in flowing 0.5% O2/He (Praxair, 99.99%,
1.0 cm3 g−1 s−1) for 6 h before exposure to ambient air. The dispersions
of the Ir-SiO2 were subsequently adjusted by oxidative and reductive
treatments followed by passivation, as summarized in Table 1.

2.2. Metal Cluster Dispersion and Elemental Analysis. The
mean diameters of supported Ir, Rh, and Pt clusters were determined
using volumetric uptakes of H2, O2, and CO and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). Volumetric uptakes were measured at 298 K using
a manual glass chemisorption unit. The sample was first treated in
flowing H2 (Praxair, 99.999%, 0.33 cm

3 g−1 s−1) by heating to 598 at
0.083 K s−1 and holding for 1 h, after which, the sample was evacuated
for 1 h at 598 K and cooled to 298 K. Uptakes were measured between
0.1 and 1 kPa H2, and the sample was evacuated again at 298 K for
0.25 h. Uptakes were then measured again at the same conditions,
and the difference between the two isotherms (after extrapolation
to zero pressure) was defined as the irreversible hydrogen uptake.
The irreversible adsorption of O2 (Praxair, 99.99%) and CO (Praxair,
99.5%) were measured at 298 K as a single isotherm, following
identical H2 treatment and evacuation routines, and extrapolated to
zero pressure to determine the total O2 and CO uptakes. The number
of exposed metal atoms (Ms) was estimated assuming adsorption
stoichiometries of 1/1 for H/Ms, O/Ms, and CO/Ms.

41 The mean
cluster diameter (<dchem>) for each sample was estimated from the
measured dispersion by assuming hemispherical crystallites and the
atomic density of the bulk metals.42,43 Dispersion values determined
from H2, O2, and CO chemisorption are shown in Table 1. The metal
content of each sample was measured by inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectroscopy (Galbraith Laboratories, Inc.).

The cluster size distribution was determined by TEM imaging in
bright-field mode (Philips, CM200F) using samples applied as a fine
dust onto Cu grids coated by “lacey” carbon. Surface-averaged cluster
diameters were calculated using

representative TEM image and the cluster size distribution for the
0.7 nm Ir catalyst is shown in Figure 1, while TEM images and cluster
size distributions for the other catalysts (1.3 nm Ir, 2.7 nm Ir, 0.9 nm
Rh, and 0.6 nm Pt) are shown in Supporting Information (Figures
S1−S4). Values of <dTEM> and <dchem> are in excellent agreement for
metal clusters <1 nm in diameter (Table 1), however, dTEM is larger
than dchem for 2.7 nm Ir clusters, perhaps because TEM overlooks a
significant number of very small (<0.3 nm) clusters.

2.3. Catalytic Rates and Selectivities. Catalytic reactions were
carried out in a packed-bed held within a stainless steel tube (3/8”
O.D.) and accurately described by plug-flow hydrodynamics. This
tubular reactor was placed within a three-zone resistively heated
furnace; the bed temperature was held constant using temperature
controllers (Watlow, 96) and measured with a type K thermocouple
held within a coaxially aligned 1/16 in. stainless steel sheath within
the bed. The catalysts were mixed with additional SiO2 (Cab-O-Sil
HS-5, washed with deionized water and treated in flowing dry air at

793 K for 5 h) to avoid axial or radial temperature gradients. The
reactor pressure was controlled using a dome-loaded pressure regulator
(Mity-Mite, S91XW).
Catalysts were treated in flowing H2 (Praxair, 99.999%, 50 cm

3 g−1 s−1)
at ambient pressure by heating to 673 at 0.083 K s−1 and holding for
2 h before all catalytic measurements. H2 (Praxair, 99.999%), ethane
(5% ethane, 10% Ar, 85% He, Praxair, certified grade), propane (10%
propane, 5% Ar, 85% He, Praxair, certified grade), and n-butane (10%
n-butane, 5% Ar, 85% He, Praxair, certified-grade) were metered using
mass flow controllers (Parker, 201). Liquid hydrocarbons (n-hexane,
Alfa-Aesar, 99%; n-octane, Sigma-Aldrich, analytical grade; n-decane,
Sigma-Aldrich, analytical grade) were introduced using a high-pressure
syringe pump (Isco, 500D). Transfer lines, before and after the reactor,
were maintained at ∼423 K to prevent condensation of reactants or
products.
Molecular speciation of all streams was carried out by gas

chromatography (Agilent GC, 5890) using a methyl silicone capillary
column (HP-1, 50 m × 0.32 mm ×1.05 μm) and flame ionization
detection. Standard compounds and an isoparaffin mixture (Sigma-
Aldrich) were used for assigning chromatographic features; assign-
ments were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Agilent, 5975C). All
rates are reported at <10% reactant conversions to measure primary
reactions and to ensure differential conditions. Turnover rates are
reported as moles of carbon converted per unit time normalized by the
number of surface metal atoms. Stated uncertainties are equivalent to
two-standard deviations, i.e., 95% confidence intervals. Hydrogenolysis
selectivities are reported as ratios of turnover rates for forming dif-
ferent products and are normalized by the number of C−C bonds
present in the reactant that could cleave to form each product.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Mechanistic Interpretation of Kinetics and
Reactive Species Compositions. Figure 2 shows turnover
rates for the cleavage of 1C−1C bonds in ethane (superscript
denotes the number of alkyl groups bonded to the C-atom),
2C−1C bonds in propane, and all 2C−2C and 2C−1C bonds in
C4−C10 n-alkanes as a function of H2 pressure (0.1−5.5 MPa;
20 kPa alkane; 593 K) on 0.7 nm Ir clusters. Alkane hydro-
genolysis turnover rates depend on alkane and H2 pressures,
which determine the number and degree of unsaturation of the
reactive and unreactive chemisorbed species.3,10,17,45 At low H2
pressures, n-alkane hydrogenolysis rates increase with increas-
ing H2 pressure (e.g., n-hexane, n-octane, Figure 2 (a)), because
of a concomitant increase in the H-content of the pool of
adsorbed hydrocarbons. These data indicate that the specific
chemisorbed species that cleave the C−C bond contain a larger
number of H-atoms than the average number of H-atoms
present within all adsorbed species. Turnover rates ultimately
reach maximum values and then decrease with increasing H2
pressure because chemisorbed species become more saturated
than the intermediates that lead to C−C bond cleavage. At
these higher H2 pressures, chemisorbed hydrogen atoms (H*)
replace hydrocarbon-derived species as the most-abundant
surface intermediates (MASI). Figure 2 (b) shows that ethane
and n-hexane hydrogenolysis turnover rates on 0.9 nm Rh and
0.6 nm Pt clusters depend on the H2 pressure in ways that are

consistent with the behavior and chemical interpretation of
alkane and H2 reactants on Ir clusters (Figure 2 (a)).
Scheme 1 shows a sequence of elementary steps consistent

with the observed kinetic effects of the alkane and H2 pressures
(Figure 2) on hydrogenolysis turnover rates on metal clusters:46−48

In this scheme, (*) denotes exposed metal atoms, and X*
and *X* are α-coordinated and α,β-coordinated intermediates,

respectively. H2 dissociation (1.1) and all hydrogenation−
dehydrogenation (1.2) and adsorption−desorption (1.3) steps
are assumed to be quasi-equilibrated and to form a pool of
H-deficient adsorbed species (CnH2n+2−z, z is the number of
H-atoms removed from each alkane). These equilibrium
assumptions were confirmed for cycloalkanes and isoalkanes,
for which the respective alkenes are detectable, at similar
conditions.46,47 Equilibrium n-alkene concentrations are below
detection limits at the conditions of our experiments (10−5−
10−4 Pa alkenes),49 but quantum chemical calculations show
that on Ir forward and reverse barriers to remove up to four
H-atoms from ethane are less, by 60 kJ mol−1, than barriers to
cleave the C−C bond, indicating that dehydrogenation steps
are quasi-equilibrated.46

Quasi-equilibrated H−H and C−H bond activation steps
precede kinetically relevant C−C bond cleavage steps (1.4)47 in
α,β-coordinated reactive intermediates with a given H-content
(*CnH2n+2−y*, y is the number of H-atoms removed from the
n-alkane reactant to form the reactive intermediate); these inter-
mediates exist as part of the equilibrated pool of H-deficient
intermediates. Transition-state theory assumes that the activated
complex that cleaves the C−C bond exists in hypothetical
equilibrium with the H-deficient reactive intermediates.50 C−C
bond cleavage forms two hydrocarbon fragments (CaHa′* and
CbHb′*) bound to the surface through their terminal C-atoms,
and these fragments hydrogenate and desorb as smaller alkanes
in subsequent quasi-equilibrated steps (1.5).
Scheme 1 leads to hydrogenolysis rates proportional to

the concentration of the reactive unsaturated intermediate

in which kR is the C−C bond cleavage rate constant. The

in terms of H2 and alkane (RH) pressures (PH2, PRH). This
equation contains equilibrium constants for alkane dehydrogen-
ation (KD,y) and for adsorption of species with y H-atoms
removed from the alkane (KA,y). Here, [*] denotes the number
of unoccupied sites and [L] the total number of active surface
sites, which is equal to the number of Ms atoms. Equation 3
depends on [*]2 because α,β-coordinated reactive species occupy
two vicinal sites (*−*)3 and the C−C cleavage fragments each
require one site for binding.48,51 The full rate equation has a
complex form (shown in the Supporting Information) that
precludes direct chemical interpretations of turnover rate
measurements; however, this equation becomes much simpler
when H* or alkane-derived species become the MASI.
At low H2/RH reactant ratios, cluster surfaces become

covered by an equilibrated pool of alkane-derived species
[*CnH2n+2−z*], with z values set by the prevalent H2 pressure
and by the values of KD,z and KA,z, which reflect homolytic
C−H and metal−carbon (M−C) bond dissociation energies,
respectively. In this case, eq 3 becomes

in which zeff represents the average number of H-atoms
removed from alkanes to form the pool of equilibrated species,
and KD,zeff and KA,zeff are effective equilibrium constants for the
dehydrogenation of the alkane to the pool of H-deficient species
and for their chemisorption on cluster surfaces, respectively.
Equation 4 is consistent with hydrogenolysis rates that increase
with H2 pressure at low H2 pressures (Figure 2 (a, b)), for
which the mean H-content of alkane-derived intermediates is
less than in the intermediate that cleaves C−C bonds (zeff > y).
Equation 4 is also consistent with hydrogenolysis rates that are
independent of alkane pressure when alkane-derived inter-
mediates are the MASI.47 The lumped nature of the kinetic and
thermodynamic terms in eq 4 precludes a more precise
mechanistic analysis from rate data measured in this kinetic
regime. Only differences between y and zeff are measurable,
making the nature of the reactive species (*CnH2n+2−y*), the
composition of the surface pool (*CnH2n+2−z*), and the relevant
equilibrium constants (KD,y, KA,y, KD,zeff, and KA,zeff) inaccessible
to experimental verification.

This equation allows the effects of H2 pressure on rates to be
used to determine the number of H-atoms (y) that must be
removed from the alkane to form the intermediate that cleaves
the C−C bonds. Equation 5 is consistent with the observed
decrease in rates with increasing H2 pressure (Figure 2 (a, b))
and with the linear dependence of hydrogenolysis rates on
n-alkane,48 isoalkane,46 and cycloalkane pressures at high
H2/RH ratios.

47

The mechanistic interpretation of eq 5 allows hydrogenolysis
rates to be expressed in terms of the rate constant for cleaving
the C−C bond in the reactive intermediate and the equilibrium
constants for forming the specific intermediate that undergoes
C−C bond cleavage, without needing to consider the entire
pool of H-deficient species. This, however, requires exper-
imental verification that H* is indeed the MASI and that y is
invariant with H2 pressure. These requirements do not appear
to have consistently been met in previous studies, as reported
by Bond3 and references therein.

Measured rates (Figure 2; 0.7 nm Ir clusters) are consistent
with a λ of 3.0 ± 0.2 for all n-alkanes. This is shown by the data
in Figure 3 (a), in which rates multiplied by (PH2)

3 reach
constant values at high H2 pressures for all n-alkanes. These
data indicate that all n-alkanes (C2−C10) lose four H-atoms
(y = 4.0 ± 0.3) to form the intermediate that undergoes C−C
bond cleavage. The specific structure of these reactive species
cannot be determined more precisely from these data, but the
tendency of C-atoms to adopt tetrahedral coordinations52 and
the enthalpic preference for M−C bonds52 over the sp or sp2
hybridizations of CC or CC bonds53 suggest that one
M−C bond replaces each H-atom removed from the alkane.
Entropy considerations indicate that conformational freedom
in chemisorbed hydrocarbons favors the formation of surface
attachments at vicinal C-atoms, making it likely that all four
M−C bonds form at adjacent C-atoms to give α,β-bound
intermediates with tetra-σ or di-σ/π bonds to the cluster
surface.3,54,55

Figure 3 (b) confirms that C−C bond cleavage on 0.9 nm Rh
clusters and 0.6 nm Pt clusters occurs in similarly dehydro-
genated reactive intermediates for ethane (y = 4.0 ± 0.6 (Rh)
and 2.6 ± 0.6 (Pt)) and n-hexane (y = 2.6 ± 0.4 (Rh) and 3.5 ±
0.4 (Pt)). Yet, the compositions of reactive intermediates differ
among Ir, Rh, and Pt because differences between C−C and

C−H bond activation energies on each metal cause C−C bond
cleavage to occur after fewer H-atoms have been removed from
alkanes on Rh and Pt.
C−C bonds can cleave at nonterminal (NT, 2C−2C) or

given by the respective values of A (eq 7) for each C−C bond
position on H*-covered Ir surfaces (eq 5; H* as MASI). The
βNT−T values for C4−C10 n-alkanes do not depend on H2
pressure on H*-saturated Ir clusters (Figure 4), indicating that
the alkane-derived species that form kinetically relevant transi-
tion states for hydrogenolysis of 2C−1C or 2C−2C bonds in a
given n-alkane contain an identical number of H-atoms.
3.2. Activation Enthalpies and Entropies for n-Alkane

Hydrogenolysis. The kinetic response of hydrogenolysis rates
to H2 (Figure 2) and alkane pressures

46,48,56,57 indicates that
all steps preceding C−C bond cleavage are quasi-equilibrated.
For all kinetic regimes and surface coverages, α,β-bound
reactive species remain quasi-equilibrated with gaseous H2
and n-alkane reactants, as shown by the facile equilibration of
cycloalkane−arene47 and isoalkane−isoalkene46 mixtures at
similar conditions and by theoretical estimates that show
forward and reverse barriers for C−H bond cleavage are much
less than those for C−C bond cleavage in ethane derived
surface intermediates on Ir.48

Transition-state theory invokes a hypothetical equilibrium
between reactants and activated complexes50 in elementary
steps; in this case, this requires that the transition state be also
equilibrated with gaseous alkane reactants, as shown in Scheme 2.
The lumping of all equilibrated elementary steps leading to the
transition state that mediates the cleavage of the C−C bond (1.4)
on H*-covered Ir surfaces, reflected in the functional form of
eq 5, gives the overall stoichiometric reaction:

Here, K′⧧ is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the
transition state (*CnH2n‑2*

⧧) and λ H2 molecules (λ = 3 on 0.7 nm
Ir (Scheme 2) but is between 2.3 and 3.0 for ethane and hexane
on Rh and Pt clusters, Table S1, Supporting Information) by
dehydrogenating the gaseous alkane and desorbing two H* to
form the *−* site pair required to bind the transition state on
H*-covered surfaces. Thus, on 0.7 nm Ir, eq 10 takes the form
CnH2n+2 + 2H* *CnH2n−2*

⧧ + 3H2. Then, hydro-
genolysis turnover rates given by transition-state theory are
equal to the concentration of the activated complexes multiplied
by the frequency at which they cleave the C−C bond50

where kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants,

(calculated from partition functions for the activated complex
which exclude the C−C bond stretch). This K⧧ value reflects
the free energy of activation (ΔG⧧), which contains the additive
contributions of all preceding steps.
The path-independent properties of state functions, such as

free energies, allow ΔG⧧ to be expressed in terms of a hypo-
thetical sequence of steps, chosen to include steps with
thermodynamic properties that are tabulated or accessible to
statistical mechanics formalisms.49 The sequence of reactions in
Scheme 1 can be described by such a Born−Haber thermo-
chemical pathway, which includes free energy changes
associated with alkane dehydrogenation to form the gaseous
analogue of the dehydrogenated reactive intermediate (1.2,
ΔGD), the recombinative desorption of two H* from the
surface (1.1, ΔGH2), and the adsorption of the gaseous
analogue of the reactive dehydrogenated alkane on *−* (1.3,
ΔGA). Subsequently, the transition state forms (1.4, ΔGR) and
the C−C bond cleaves.

tributions from each hypothetical step in the thermochemical

Figure 5 shows K⧧ values determined from measured turn-
over rates for the cleavage of 2C−2C and 2C−1C bonds in
n-butane, n-hexane, n-octane, and n-decane and for the cleavage
of 2C−1C and 1C−1C bonds in propane and ethane,
respectively, as a function of reciprocal temperature. Turnover
rates were measured at high H2/RH ratios (60−175) to ensure
that surfaces remained saturated with H* at all temperatures.
Table 2 shows ΔH⧧ and ΔS⧧ values and their 95% confidence
intervals for hydrogenolysis of C2−C10 n-alkanes on 0.7 nm Ir
clusters. ΔH⧧ and ΔS⧧ values for ethane and n-hexane on the
surfaces of 1.3 nm Ir, 2.7 nm Ir, 0.9 nm Rh, and 0.6 nm Pt
clusters are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S1).
Measured ΔH⧧ values on 0.7 nm Ir clusters are largest for

ethane (257 ± 2 kJ mol−1 K−1) and decrease monotonically
with increasing n-alkane size, reaching constant values for
C6−C10 (216 ± 4 kJ mol

−1 K−1). The value of ΔH⧧ for 1C−1C
bond cleavage in ethane is larger than for 2C−1C bond cleavage

in propane (by 27 kJ mol−1) and for 2C−2C and 2C−1C bond
cleavage in longer n-alkanes (by 40 kJ mol−1). ΔH⧧ values for
ethane are consistently 20−50 kJ mol−1 larger than for the ΔH⧧
for n-hexane, and this difference persists independent of cluster
size (0.7 nm, 1.3 nm, and 2.7 nm Ir clusters) or metal identity
(0.7 nm Ir, 0.9 nm Rh, and 0.6 nm Pt clusters) (Table S1,
Supporting Information). These different enthalpies reflect, in
part, concomitant differences in homolytic C−C bond dissocia-
tion energies (BDE(C−C)), which decrease with increasing

aFor this example, the value of λ from eq 13 is 3. The free energy of activation (ΔG⧧) is given by the sum of the free energies of dehydrogenation
(ΔGD), hydrogen desorption (ΔGH2), adsorption of the dehydrogenated hydrocarbon (ΔGA), and the formation of the transition state from the
reactive intermediate (ΔGR). Free energies of intermediate species cancel such that ΔG

⧧ (eq 13) is given by the difference between the free energies
of the reactants (hexane and 2H*) and the “products” (the transition state and 3H2(g)) in the stoichiometric reaction that forms the C−C cleavage
transition state (eq 10).

substitution at the C-atoms in a given C−C bond in alkanes.
For example, tabulated BDE(C−C) values show that the
1C−1C bond in ethane is 19 ± 4.2 kJ mol−1 stronger than
2C−1C bonds in C3−C6 n-alkanes and 35 ± 4.2 kJ mol

−1

stronger than 2C−2C bonds in C4−C6 n-alkanes.
53 Figure 6

shows that ΔH⧧ for hydrogenolysis of n-alkanes on H*-covered
Ir clusters reflect differences in their BDE(C−C) values
(averaged over all C−C bonds).53 Yet, ΔH⧧ values for cleavage
at the different C−C positions in a given n-alkane (C4−C10) are
similar, suggesting that ΔH⧧ values for breaking 1C−2C and
2C−2C bonds depend also on factors other than BDE(C−C),
such as steric repulsion effects,58 which tend to destabilize
transition states for 2C−2C bonds more than at terminal 1C−2C
bonds. The similar ΔH⧧ values for n-hexane, n-octane, and
n-decane reflect the weak effects of additional 2C−2C bonds on
average BDE(C−C) values for n-alkanes.53 Hydrogenolysis
turnover rates differ by 108 between ethane and n-decane (593 K;
Figure 2) as a consequence of concomitant differences in K⧧

(Figure 5), which cannot solely reflect relatively small changes in
ΔH⧧ with chain length. (K⧧ values are defined per mole alkane
and therefore do not artificially increase values of K⧧ for longer
n-alkanes, which would occur if rates were define per mole
carbon.) We conclude, as a result, that such reactivity differences
must reflect strong effects of chain length on hydrogenolysis
ΔS⧧ values.

ΔS⧧ values for C−C bond cleavage in n-alkanes (Table 2;
0.7 nm Ir clusters) are large and positive (164−259 J mol−1 K−1),
consistent with large entropic gains in forming the transition
state, which result from the evolution of three H2 molecules
(4 H-atoms from the alkane and two H* desorbed to bind the
transition state) from the relevant reactant state (eq 10). Ethane
and n-hexane hydrogenolysis on Rh, Pt, and larger Ir clusters also
exhibit large ΔS⧧ (Table S1, Supporting Information, 41−193
J mol−1 K−1) that increase with the amount of H2 produced (λ).
These data show that hydrogenolysis represents a prototypical
example of a chemical reaction with a high activation barrier and
which is largely driven by large entropy gains in the equilibrated
steps that form the transition state. These reactions overcome
high enthalpic barriers (Table 2, 216−257 kJ mol−1) for cleaving
strong C−C bonds only as a result of the entropy gained by the
evolution of H2(g), by the quasi-equilibrated elementary steps
that precede transition state formation, even though each overall
hydrogenolysis event actually consumes one H2(g) molecule.
The functional form of ΔG⧧ (ΔH⧧ − TΔS⧧, eq 14) shows that
entropy gains decrease ΔG⧧ more effectively as the temperature
of the reaction increases.
The entropy of the transition state mediating C−C bond

cleavage (S⧧) can be estimated from measured activation
entropies (ΔS⧧) by rearranging the terms in eq 14:

λ= Δ − · + · * +
⧧ ⧧S S S S S2H2 H RH (15)

The entropy of H2(g) (SH2) can be estimated using statistical
mechanics formalisms with partition functions for three-
dimensional translation of ideal gases, rotation of rigid rotors,
and harmonic oscillators.59 At the temperatures of catalytic
hydrogenolysis (500 − 700 K), H2 adsorbs dissociatively
and H* behaves as a two-dimensional ideal gas with one vibra-
tional mode perpendicular to the metal surface (e.g., ν(Ir−H) =
2030 cm−1 on Ir(111)).60 Activation entropies for hydro-
genolysis are measured on H*-saturated surfaces; therefore,
SH* values were calculated for H/Ms coverages of unity from
the relevant partition functions61 and give an entropy of 36
J mol−1 K−1 for SH* (i.e., 72 J mol

−1 K−1 per mole H2). SH*
values at saturation H* coverages are insensitive to the
elemental identity of the metal cluster, because the identity of
the surface metal atoms minimally influences the frequency of
the vibrational mode perpendicular to the surface and the area
for two-dimensional translation. Calculations for SRH use parti-
tions functions for three-dimensional translation, rigid rotors,
and vibrations from normal modes obtained from coupled-
cluster doubles (CCD) level of theory with the 6-31G* basis
set.62 These calculations give entropies that are 1−5% smaller
than the tabulated data49 for these gaseous species because
such calculations neglect configurational entropies from trans,
gauche−, and gauche+ rotational conformations about C−C
bonds.63 Thus, we choose to calculate S⧧ from experiments
using SRH values determined from the partition functions
described above so that comparisons between calculated and
predicted S⧧ values use similar partition functions (see below)
for all species and are not subject to systematic bias by
incorporating tabulated data only in calculations for gaseous
alkanes and H2.
Table 2 shows the entropies for all stable gaseous and surface

species involved in alkane hydrogenolysis; these values, taken
together with measured ΔS⧧ values, give the entropy for the
C−C bond cleavage transition states (eq 15). These S⧧ values
increase sharply with increasing n-alkane chain length (by 555
J mol−1 K−1 between ethane and n-decane); notably, the

increases in S⧧ with chain length are larger than for the
respective gaseous alkanes (SRH, 452 J mol

−1 K−1). Thus,
transition states for larger alkanes retain a larger fraction of the
entropy (SRH) of their gaseous precursors, largely in the form of
intramolecular vibrations.61 This accounts for the larger ΔS⧧
(Table 2) and the higher hydrogenolysis turnover rates
(Figure 2 (a)) of longer chain n-alkanes. Similar effects also
account for the difference in ΔS⧧ (Table S1, Supporting
Information) and turnover rates (Figure 2 (b)) between ethane
and n-hexane on Rh, Pt, and larger Ir clusters. Thus,
hydrogenolysis rates increase with the chain length of n-alkane
reactants because of ubiquitous entropy effects that do not
depend on the size or identity of the metal clusters used as
catalysts.
3.3. Statistical Mechanics Descriptions of Hydro-

genolysis Transition-State Entropies (S⧧). Differences in
ΔS⧧ (Table 2) cause the large differences in hydrogenolysis
turnover rates among n-alkanes (Figure 2). ΔS⧧ values can be
estimated using statistical mechanics formalisms for the
proposed α,β-bound transition-state structure (Figure 7).

Metal-catalyzed C−C bond cleavage is exothermic (−30 to
−200 kJ mol−1) because two metal−carbon bonds (e.g.,
BDE(Pt−C) = 225−270 kJ mol−1)64,65 form for each C−C
bond cleaved (BDE(M−C) = 350− 439 kJ mol−1);53 as a
result, Hammond’s postulate suggests that the C−C bond
cleavage transition state occurs early along the reaction
coordinate and resembles its α,β-bound reactive precursor.66

Thus, we propose a transition state for terminal C−C hydro-
genolysis in n-hexane (Figure 7, for metal clusters <1 nm in
diameter, depicted as a 10-atom truncated cuboctahedron)
similar in structure to the α,β-bound hydrocarbons detected
spectroscopically on metal surfaces.67,68 Such structures contain
alkyl chains at each of the two C-atoms in the α,β-bound C−C
unit; its configuration preserves the bond lengths and angles of
the gaseous analogs in every part of the complex (0.109 nm
C−H and 0.154 nm C−C bonds; 109.5° H−C−H and C−C−C
bond angles).69,70

The partition function for these complexes is given by the
product of the those for two-dimensional (surface) translation
(qt,2D), vibrations (qv), and one-dimensional rotation (qr,1D) and
for rotational conformations about each of the C−C bonds (qc):

where νi is the frequency of the ith vibrational mode. These

the gaseous alkanes (obtained from coupled-cluster doubles
(CCD) level of theory with the 6-31G* basis set),62 except that
the transition state excludes the ν(C−C) mode corresponding
to the reaction coordinate50 and the four ν(C−H) modes lost
from abstracting the four H-atoms from the surface-bound
carbon atoms. Vibrational modes include stretching, bending
and deformation, as well as hindered rotations of methylene
and methyl units within chains. Vibration normal to the surface
corresponds to a ν(C−Ir) like mode with a frequency assumed
to be 491 cm−1, by analogy with those reported for methyl
groups at on-top sites on Ir(111).71

The one-dimensional rotational partition function, qr,1D,
describes rotation about the surface normal by the two pendant
alkyl chains attached to the α and β C-atoms bound to the
surface (Figure 7). This motion is described as a rigid rotor59

reflects the mass (mi) and distance from the rotational axis (ri)

Alkyl chains have C−C and C−H bond lengths and angles equal
to those in gaseous alkanes.69,70 Since it is necessary to assume a
conformational structure in order to calculate Iz, the alkyl chains
are treated as pure trans-conformers because such configurations
are most stable in gaseous species (by 2.5 kJ mol−1 per C−C unit
over gauche-conformers)72 and predominate in adsorbed hydro-
carbons.67,68 Although a finite number of other conformers exist,

their combined population is less than that of the pure trans-
conformers, and consequently we make the simplifying
approximation that their contributions to the degrees of freedom
of the transition state can be treated separately from Iz and qr,1D.
The values of Iz as a function of the number of carbon atoms in
the alkyl chain are reported in the Supporting Information
(Figure S5).
The conformational partition function, qc, accounts for the

probability that the alkyl chains can adopt one of three distinct
rotational conformations (trans-, gauche+, and gauche-).73 These
trans and gauche conformations introduce degrees of freedom
(and entropy gains) not included in partition functions
describing the translational, vibrational, and rotational motions
of the activated complex. The value of qc depends on the number
of C−C bonds (n − 1, where n is the number of C-atoms) in
the n-alkane. The conformational partition function for a linear,
α,β-bound hydrocarbon is equal to73,74

where x denotes the specific degree of freedom. Figure 8 (a, b)
shows that entropies of translation, vibrations, and conforma-
tions depend only on the mass and on the total number of C−C
and C−H bonds of the transition state (and thus on the chain
length of the n-alkane reactant). Rotational entropies, however,
differ depending on the location of the α,β C-atoms (the points
of attachment to the surface in the one-body transition state)
along the chain because this location determines the size of the
two pendant alkyl chains and consequently their respective
moments of inertia (Iz, Figure S5, Supporting Information). The
rotational entropy for the transition state is equal to the sum of
the entropies of each independent alkyl chain, which increase
monotonically with the length of the alkyl chains (Figure 8).
Yet, the greatest and most consequential entropy gains per
additional C-atom occur when the number of C-atoms in the
alkyl chain increases from 1 to 2 (Figure 8), while the addition
of subsequent C-atoms lead to smaller gains in rotational
entropy. The amount of rotational entropy gained by increasing
the length of an alkyl chain by one carbon atom reflects the
natural logarithm of the ratio of Iz values for chains with n + 1
and n C-atoms (eqs 20, 21, 23). Iz increases rapidly (eq 21)
when the first C-atom is added to the α or β C-atom (i.e., the
transition from methylidyne to ethylidyne), but the exponential
dependence of Iz on n decreases slightly for n > 3 (Figure S5,
Supporting Information). For example, S⧧r,1D for a single alkyl
chain increases by 32 J mol−1 K−1 as pendant chains grow
from 1 to 3 C-atoms (Figure 8), but only by 17 J mol−1 K−1 as
they grow from 3 to 10 C-atoms. Such nonlinear effects lead
to entropies that favor nonterminal over terminal C−C bond
cleavage in n-alkanes. The translational, vibrational, and
conformational entropies (Figure 8 (a, b)) of these transi-
tion states are much greater than their rotational entropies

(Figure 8 (b)) and account for hydrogenolysis turnover rates
that increase markedly with increasing n-alkane length. Yet,
rotational entropies, the smallest contributor to total entropy,
represent the sole entropic determinant of the position of C−C
bond cleavage in a given n-alkane, because such entropies reflect
partition functions that are sensitive to the length of the two
alkyl chains pendant to the α,β C-atoms bound to the surface.
The total transition state entropy (S⧧) is given by

The S⧧ estimates from statistical mechanics can be compared to
S⧧ values calculated for the cleavage of each type C−C bond
within each n-alkane (e.g., the five distinct C−C bonds in
n-decane) using eq 15, measured ΔS⧧ values, and SH2, SH*, and
SRH calculated from statistical mechanics (Table 2).

59 We note
that the analytical model for S⧧, described in eqs 15−23, does
not include any adjustable parameters. Figure 9 shows such a
comparison of S⧧ values for complexes that cleave each distinct

Pt cluster surfaces. Experimental and predicted values of S⧧ on
0.7 nm Ir clusters agree very well (the slope of the correlation
is 1.01 ± 0.03, the intercept is −7 ± 15 J mol−1 K−1, and
goodness of fit is 0.99). Predictions for S⧧ match measured
S⧧ values for ethane and n-hexane hydrogenolysis on both
1.3 and 2.7 nm Ir clusters, as well as on small Rh (0.9 nm) and

Pt (0.6 nm) clusters (Figure 9). These comparisons confirm
that the proposed transition state structure (Figure 7), and the
identity of the elementary steps and their specific kinetic and
thermodynamic relevance (Scheme 1) accurately describes the
reactivity and selectivity of surfaces for hydrogenolysis of
n-alkanes. These factors are apparently independent of the
elemental identity or size of the metal clusters. Recent work by
Campbell et al. shows that weakly adsorbed gases lose the
entropy of one-dimension of free translation with respect to the
gas-phase species and ∼1/3 of the entropy associated with the
remaining translational, rotational and vibrational degrees of
freedom in the gas-phase.75 Earnest attempts to use this alternate
model to describe the entropy of transition states for C−C bond
cleavage in these deeply dehydrogenated, and strongly bound,
hydrocarbons were unsuccessful in predicting the entropy of
these complexes or entropy differences between transition states
that cleave C−C bonds at different positions. However, such a
model may well describe the entropy of more mobile transition
states that mediate other reactions at surfaces,75 but which are
not relevant to catalytic hydrogenolysis. Subsequent publica-
tions46−48 will show that hydrogenolysis of isoalkanes and
cycloalkanes on metals can also be rigorously described by these
kinetic and thermodynamic formalisms, which appear to be
fundamental features of metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.
3.4. Enthalpic and Entropic Factors and the Location

of C−C Bond Cleavage. Activation energies are likely to
show the largest differences between nonterminal (2C−2C) and
terminal (2C−1C) bonds in C4+ n-alkanes, because these bonds
differ most markedly in their BDE(C−C)53 and in their steric
access to surface atoms.58 The ratios of nonterminal to terminal
hydrogenolysis rates (βNT−T; eq 9) reflect enthalpy and entropy
differences between the transition states that mediate the
cleavage of bonds at nonterminal and terminal positions:

Figure 10 shows that βNT−T values for n-butane, n-hexane,
n-octane, and n-decane are independent of temperature on
0.7 nm Ir, indicating that ΔH⧧ values for 2C−2C and 2C−1C
bond cleavage are actually similar (within experimental
uncertainty, ± 2 kJ mol−1) for these larger n-alkanes. Therefore,
entropy differences between the transition states (∂S⧧) for
terminal and nonterminal cleavage determine the relative rates
of location of C−C bond cleavage for a given n-alkane. ΔH⧧ for
2C−1C bonds in n-alkanes decrease with n-alkane chain length
(Table 2), even though the BDE(C−C) values for these bonds
are similar (360 ± 4.2 kJ mol−1).53 ΔH⧧ values for 2C−1C
bonds in propane (230 kJ mol−1) are larger than for 2C−1C
bonds in n-butane (228 kJ mol−1) and in longer n-alkanes
(217 kJ mol−1), because dispersion forces that scale with the
number of C-atoms in n-alkanes50 have attractive interactions
with the catalyst surface.76 These interactions stabilize both the
transition states and the adsorbed reactants, however, because
all steps that precede C−C bond rupture are quasi-equilibrated
the stability of the reactants does not influence rates or
selectivities. As shown above (Figure 10), βNT−T is unaffected
by temperature and larger than unity for all n-alkanes that
contain terminal and nonterminal C−C bonds because
transition state entropies are larger for nonterminal than
terminal C−C bond cleavage.
The effects of temperature on the ratio of turnover rates for

a given C−C bond to those for the terminal C−C bond in a
given n-alkane (βx, x denotes the bond position, with 1 assigned
to the terminal position) can be used to determine differences
in H⧧ and S⧧ between two C−C bonds:

Figure 11 shows that βx values for the three distinct C−C
bonds in n-hexane are insensitive to temperature, consistent
with similar ΔH⧧ values for all C−C bonds in n-hexane on
0.7 nm Ir. The β3 value is the largest (the central C−C bond in
n-hexane) (6.0 ± 0.5) and β values decrease as C−C bonds
approach the end of the chain (β2 is 3.5 ± 0.7). The data in
Figure 11 show that the cleavage of terminal C−C bonds is
unfavorable, because they have the smallest transition state
entropy (S⧧) within each n-alkane. The temperature independ-
ence of βx for n-butane, n-hexane, n-octane, and n-decane show

that ΔH⧧ values for all C−C bonds within a given alkane are
equal on 0.7 nm Ir (within experimental uncertainty, Table 2).
These data show that the preference for cleaving nonterminal
C−C bonds in all n-alkanes merely reflects the differences in
entropy among the transition states that mediate C−C bond
cleavage at each position.
Figure 12a shows experimental ∂S⧧ values, which reflect

entropy differences between transition states, for a specific
nonterminal C−C bond and the terminal C−C bond.

The entropic preference for rupture of a C−C bond increases
with its distance from the end of the n-alkane chain. Experi-
mental (Figure 12a) and predicted (Figure 12b) ∂S⧧ values for
n-octane show oscillations that arise solely from differences in
Sr,1D

⧧. Similar oscillatory behavior is predicted for n-decane, but
it is made indistinct by uncertainty in the experimental ∂S⧧
values. These uncertainties are due to impurities found only in
the n-decane reactant that continuously deactivated the catalyst,
which caused selectivities (at constant conversion) to change
over time perhaps as a result of S-accumulation on Ir clusters.
The oscillations in ∂S⧧ (Figure 12b, n-octane and n-decane)
result from non- linear increases in Sr,1D

⧧ with increasing chain
length of each alkyl chain, as given by eqs 20, 21, and 23. These
results and their mechanistic interpretation specifically
demonstrate that statistical mechanics can be used to predict
rates and selectivities of hydrogenolysis reactions on metal
clusters.
The elementary steps (Scheme 1), rate expression for H*-

covered surfaces (eq 12), and thermochemical cycle (Scheme 2)
presented here are not specific to n-alkanes or to the particular
Ir, Rh and Pt cluster catalysts used in this study. Our analysis
can be broadly applied to hydrogenolysis reactions of different
hydrocarbons (C−C bond rupture), as well as to hydrogen-
assisted heteroatom removal (C−S, C−N, and C−O bond
rupture), because the foundation of the approach is fundamental
and not limited to C−C bond chemistry. In general, C−C
bond cleavage occurs via similar pools of quasi- equilibrated
dehydrogenated organic reactants on many late transition metals
(Ir, Ru, Rh, and Pt); and hydrogenolysis reactions of isoalkanes
and cycloalkanes can be rigorously treated using similar
formalisms, as we demonstrate in later publications.46−48

4. CONCLUSIONS
Hydrogenolysis of C−C bonds in n-alkanes occurs on Ir, Rh,
and Pt clusters (0.6−2.7 nm in diameter) is accurately
described over wide-ranges of temperatures, pressures, and
coverages by a rate expression, which is derived from a series of
plausible elementary steps. n-Alkane hydrogenolysis rates and
C−C bond cleavage selectivities are consistent with kinetically
relevant C−C bond rupture that occurs in transition states
equilibrated with gaseous alkane reactants, H2(g), and hydro-
carbon- or H*-covered surfaces of metal clusters. By utilizing
this chemical equilibrium and saturating the surfaces of metal
clusters H*, hydrogenolysis turnover rates can be chemically
interpreted using a thermochemical cycle and the tenets of
transition state theory to determine the composition and
stability of transition states that cleave C−C bonds. ΔH⧧ for
C−C bond cleavage range are prohibitively large, between
257 and 217 kJ mol−1 on H*-covered Ir surfaces and correlate
with the average BDE(C−C) of the reactant alkanes. These
high ΔH⧧ require large ΔS⧧ that are achieved by the formation
of gaseous H2, which is produced by displacing two H* from
the metal surface and by dehydrogenating the reactant.
Rate constants for hydrogenolysis increase strikingly with the
length of n-alkanes, by 108 between ethane and n-decane,
as a result of ΔS⧧ increasing between ethane and n-decane
by 95 J mol−1 K−1. Entropic differences also produce distinct
selectivity patterns that favor nonterminal C−C bond cleavage
within C4+ n-alkanes. A model based on the principles of
statistical mechanics and partitions functions that describe the
translational, vibrational, rotational, and configurational free-
dom of a plausible transition state structure shows that these
differences in rates and selectivities result from differences

between S⧧ for C−C bond cleavage. Calculations show that
long chain n-alkanes retain a much larger fraction of their entropy
upon adsorption, in the form of intramolecular vibrations and
configurations, which causes hydrogenolysis turnover rates to
increase markedly with the length of the n-alkane. The position of
C−C bond cleavage within n-alkanes depends on differences in
S⧧ at intramolecular positions that solely reflect changes in the
rotational entropy of pendant alkyl chains of the α,β-bound
complex. The model to describe S⧧ is general and consistent with
kinetic measurements of hydrogenolysis on metal clusters of
different sizes and elemental identities and with isoalkanes and
cycloalkanes. As shown here, quantitative chemical descriptions of
heterogeneous catalytic reactions can be developed in order to
understand the molecular driving forces that determine rates and
selectivities for chemical conversions.

[bookmark: _Toc36021937]Introduction
Hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis processes convert various C4 feedstocks (e.g., n-butane/iso-butane, pentane, pentene, etc.) into light paraffin gases (LPG, primarily ethane and propane), which can then be used as a feedstock for light olefins (propylene and ethylene). 
C4H10 + H2 → C2H6 + C3H8
The objective of the proposed process is to investigate long-term deactivation, life-time study and regeneration of deactivated catalysts (zeolite, zeolite-like materials, or metal oxides). 
A reactor system consisting of two reactors has been retrofitted to test long-term performance of different solid catalysts and subsequent regeneration. The reactor feed for the process consists of high-pressure hydrogen (350 psi) and co-feed mixture of hydrogen, ethane (325 psig), methane and   propane (325 psig) from independent cylinders in bay 15 outside the building. A pressurized cylinder of liquid C4 located in the flammable cylinder cabinet feeds two Bronkhorst mini Cori flow liquid MFCs (flow range: 0.01 to 20 g/h (precision 0.5%)) inside the hood. The liquid C4 feed from the liquid MFC will be vaporized before being mixed with the hydrogen feed on a 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2 basis. Based on the literature, the reactor effluent or product stream may contain C1-C4 paraffin’s, small amounts of C2-C6 olefins, and small quantities of aromatics. 
Typical hydrocracking catalysts are composed of an acidic support and a metal, which work together to give the catalysts dual cracking and hydrogenation capabilities. Common supports include zeolites (e.g., modified ZSM-5), zeolite-type catalysts, and metal oxides. Metals active for hydrogenation include Pt, Pd, Ni-W, and Co-Mo, among others. The catalysts will generally be of the solid acid types, such as acidic zeolites (ZSM, USY, beta, mordenite) modified with noble or base metals. It is possible that catalysts consisting of noble or base metals supported on typical oxide supports (alumina, silica, titania, magnesia) will also be used. 
Typical hydrogenolysis catalysts are composed of supported monometallic or bimetallic catalysts. Common supports include metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, etc.), zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, NaY, etc.,), and zeolite-type catalysts. Metals active for hydrogenolysis include Pt, Ir, Rh, and Ru, among others.
Typical test conditions for deactivation typically include temperatures between RT-600 °C and high pressures between ambient pressure-280 psig. Typical test conditions for regeneration of spent catalysts include temperature 300-500 °C with 0.5 % of air in nitrogen at ambient pressure. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021938]Feed and Reaction Conditions
The reactor feed will be 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
Mixed feed line (SP-81) which contains hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. The typical mixed feed composition includes approximately ~ 74 % hydrogen, ~ 19 % methane, ~ 7 % ethane and trace amount of propane ~ 0.01 %. 
The high-pressure hydrogen line and the house high-pressure nitrogen line are regulated down to 350 psig before the mass flow controllers; the flow controllers for these lines (0-350 sccm for H2 and N2, 0-300 sccm for N2, 0-200 sccm for mixed feed) are calibrated for their respective gases. The hydrocarbon cylinder (butane, e.g.) is housed in the lab in a vented cylinder cabinet, fitted with a sprinkler head. The butane cylinder contains a dip-tube and helium blanket, and is fed via a dedicated cylinder, which is located in blue cabinet next to C4 cylinder. The feed gas pressures and others used for the GC are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 details the operating conditions for this reactor setup.

[bookmark: _Toc36021940]Catalyst
Zeolite or metal-oxide catalysts with a metal active for hydrogenation have been reported to be active for converting alkanes into LPG. A typical catalyst is platinum-loaded ZSM-5. Various modified ZSM-5 and alumina/silica are the two groups of catalyst that were studied for this reaction.  We will be testing potential literature catalysts and new catalysts from the two groups and similar types of catalysts.
The catalyst powder will be pressed and then sieved to 20-40 mesh before loading into the reactor. The catalyst loading will range between 0.1-10 g, typically 1 g catalyst. The team has to review the MSDS and health, safety and environmental hazards of chemicals used for catalyst preparation.
[bookmark: _Toc36021941]Safety concerns 
A major safety concern is the flammability of H2 and the C4 feedstock. In addition, small quantities of aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) may be present in the product stream depending on the type of catalyst used.  
The flammability limits of hydrogen are 4-74% in air; it is also a simple asphyxiant.  Hydrogen cylinders are located outside the building on the cylinder pad in bay 15.  Six pack hydrogen cylinder with regulator is used to continuously feed the H2 feed.  
The flammability limits of butane are 1.86-8.41% in air. Other possible feeds (e.g., isobuane, isobutene, etc.) have similar flammability limits. C4 will be fed from a pressurized cylinder with a helium blanket placed in a flammable cylinder cabinet. Refer to Table 14 under Section 5.5 for detailed flammability limits for methane, ethane and propane in air. 
The spent catalysts in the reactor may be treated with air for regeneration. The formation of a flammable mixture between air and H2/hydrocarbon is prevented by updating the flammability safety calculation in PLC to air. Once % HC (butane) is inside the flammable region (LFL×90% < %HC < UFL×110%), the unit will be in alarm and shut down as discussed in Section 2.7 Safety Control System (Table 10). In addition, there are three-way valves (V115, V215 for R1 and R2, respectively) that prevent mixing hydrogen with air simultaneously. Reactors will be purged with N2 before and after regeneration. 
As mentioned earlier, the reactor product stream may contain a small amount of benzene, a known carcinogen.  Operator exposure to the product stream is potentially harmful.  Operator entry in the hood is prohibited when feed is flowing to either unit. The entire process will take place inside the hood and will be leak checked prior to each run. Handling of feed and liquid products will require proper PPE as described in a later section. 
Table 4 below shows the physical properties of the feed and possible products. See Section 5 Industrial hygiene for more information on physical properties of feed and expected effluent.
The operation of the reactor is unattended.  Simultaneous malfunction of the hood and a reactor fitting or valve leak could allow escape of hydrocarbons into the lab. To handle this scenario, the hood function will be monitored continuously such that if the air flow in the hood falls below 70% of the normal, the unit shuts down in latching mode. The unit will restart only when the operator acknowledges the hood shutdown and resets all sensor monitoring.

[bookmark: _Toc36021942]Unit Description
[bookmark: _Toc36021943]Reactor description
The reactor is a 1/2” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel with VCR fittings.  The ½” O.D. x .049” wall thickness stainless steel tubing has a pressure rating of 3700 psig at a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C.  The allowable working pressure rating at elevated temperatures for this tubing is 2923 psig at 426 °C and 2812 psig at 537°C.  It is anticipated this process will screen catalysts at RT – 600 °C. 
The reactor tube is fitted with connections to accept S.S. ½” fittings and reduced to 1/4” fittings and tubing outside the furnace.  The reactor is fitted internally with a 1/8” seven-point thermocouple probe.  There is an internal thermocouple within each of the two heating zones that has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.  The additional points are to monitor the catalyst bed and reactor temperature profile.  The thermocouple is 316 stainless steel.  Reactors will be visually inspected for evidence of corrosion or fatigue after every run and replaced as necessary or at least every 6 months.
Reactor temperature is controlled by a 15” two-zone Applied Test System (ATS) clam shell furnace.  The furnace has a maximum temperature rating of 1100 °C. The furnace consists of two zones, each 6 inches long.  No reactor fittings are located inside the furnace; the top reactor fitting is 4 inches above the heated zone and the bottom reactor fitting is 4 inches below the heated zone.  Each furnace zone is controlled by an independent thermocouple in the furnace wall.  The two zones are independent with their own latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C. In addition, as stated above, one internal thermocouple in the reactor lined up with each zone has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.
In addition, 1/4” and 3/8” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel can also be used as reactors by swapping the ½” reactor. The pressure ratings of reactors with different O.D. over a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C are presented below in Table 5.

*Pressure in psig
Internal thermocouples are used for a ½” O.D. reactor alone as the smaller reactor diameters do not have enough room to accommodate the 1/8” thermo-well. 
Heat tapes associated with each unit are for pre-heating the feed, and keeping products heated to the GC sampling valve after the reactor. The heating tapes on each of the feed lines have a maximum rating 720 °C.  They will be operated at a maximum of 250 °C and will be controlled with a PID controller using a K thermocouple mounted on the tubing surface. The heat tapes have a unit shutdown latching alarm set at 300 °C.
Reactor pressure is anticipated to be at approximately 100 psig; however, a backpressure regulator (BPR-R101 and BPR-R201 respectively on reactors 1 and 2 with a pressure range of 0-500 psig) will allow catalyst testing at pressures up to 300 psig.  The readout for the reactor pressure is located upstream of the reactor and will be via a 0-300 (PT-111) and 0-300 psig (PT-211) range process strain gauges connected to a digital readout on reactor 1 and 2 respectively.  The strain gauge generates a 4-20 milliamp signal that is calibrated in the corresponding pressure range.  The digital readout connects to the alarm box which is set to alarm at 300 psig.  A 0-600 psig dial gauge is also present as additional pressure readout on each reactor feed line.  If pressure exceeds the alarm set point (280 psig), the unit will shut down (latching).  There is also a pressure safety valve (PRV-111 and PRV-211 on reactors 1 and 2 respectively) before the reactor, and on each feed line, set to relieve at 400 psig. High-pressure nitrogen will be used for leak testing at 300 psig.
Hereinafter, unit shutdown means that power is cut from all furnace heaters, heat tapes and all solenoid valve including zero the flow on all the MFCs. It also includes zeroing the flow on the liquid MFCs to stop hydrocarbon feed from flowing. The bellows valves on the H2 fail close meaning flow is cut off, and the Nitrogen bellows valves fail open (except for the case where unit shutdown is triggered by pressure alarm) allowing purge flow through the reactor.  Each unit has its own shutdown independent of the other reactor. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021944]Temperature control and alarms
Temperature control is done by the ABB 700F Freelance PLC, through a set of solid state relays on the system.  The system is designed to monitor High, Sensor Break, and Loop Break alarms and display alerts.  Transfer line alarms will shut down only the individual transfer line output.  Temperature alarms on either zone of a reactor furnace or the catalyst bed will stop output for both zones of that furnace, change all of the mass flow controller set points to zero, the nitrogen purge valves will open and an alarm indicator will appear on the control system screen.  All of these alarms are latching.  
The universal transmitters, PR 4116, are configured as separate temperature alarm units.  They are independent of the ABB control system and receive the thermocouple inputs directly. They can also convert the thermocouple input to a voltage or current output, which we send to the ABB control system for monitoring and data logging.  The PR 4116s are equipped with relays which initiate shutdown actions via separate solid state relays. 
Thermocouple being inside or outside side of catalyst bed are not affecting temperature control and alarms system in fact thermocouple outside of bed will have quicker response or closer to furnace temperature. The temperature alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 6.

The ABB control system will display the reactor pressures. The Pressure Alarms are controlled by the universal transmitters, PR 4116.  The alarm units will shut down a reactor in case of high pressure. The sensors for the system are Omega pressure transducers (PT111 & PT211).  The PR4116 units retransmit the input received from the transducers to the ABB control system for display and data logging. 
There are also spring-loaded pressure relief valves, PRV111 and PRV211, which are set to 400 psig.  These valves are a fail-safe, in the event that the pressure transducers or the safety components fail. The pressure alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 10.

Once reactor is plugged and pressurized, manual tree-way valve V116, V150 (Reactor 1) and V216, V250 (Reactor 2) will be used to relief the pressure in the reactors.
[bookmark: _Toc513205141]Utilities:  Power & Ventilation
The ABB control system and PR4116 alarm units will be connected to an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) so that the whole logic system, except for the heaters, will remain powered in case of a temporary loss of facility power.  The UPS will provide 4.5 minutes of 120V AC.  In an extended power outage, the PR 4116 alarm units will fail-safe, cutting power to all heaters and stopping all feeds.  After restoration of power, they will need to be reset to resume heating and flow. [Latch]
The unit is equipped with a Hood Flow Sensor which will sense a loss of ventilation.  This sensor is connected to a PR4116 universal transmitter, and will initiate a total shutdown of both reactors on a loss of ventilation with maximum delay of 30 seconds.  When normal ventilation resumes, the alarm unit will have to be reset in order to resume operation of the unit.
[bookmark: _Toc513205142]Valve actions upon alarm
Upon alarm, a number of valves actuate, shut off all pertinent flows, and allow for depressurization and purging of the system. Table 9 describes valve actions and purposes in detail.

Products are expected to be in gas phase predominantly.  Possible effluent components are unreacted H2, and C1–C6 Paraffins, olefins, and aromatics.  The higher carbon compounds (> C6) are not expected, but are possible.  All will be taken into account for safety and analytical reasons. Any effluent condensate will be collected in knockout pot and the remaining gas will be vented to the hood. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021948]Reactor sampling and analytical
After the reaction section, the flow of material is directed away from the reactor and towards the analysis section. Immediately after leaving the reactor the pressure and temperature of the stream is measured, after which the gas is passed through a heated back-pressure regulator before being directed into a Valco sampling valve. After leaving this valve the flow is directed to the GC or the knockout pot. The entire analytical system after the reactor requires heat input to keep the products from having the possibility to condense. Therefore, all lines are heat traced after the reactor to prevent such condensation.
The GC is equipped with one FID (hydrogen and air as flame and helium as a carrier gases) and one TCD (Argon as carrier gas).

The potential hazards can be broken into three major categories: temperature, pressure, utilities and flammability (discussed in section 2.2).  The unit will have various high temperature and pressure alarms, and each of these will initiate different shut-down actions. The alarm actions are summarized in Table 10.

Wetted parts of the system are all compatible with expected and possible components of the feed and effluent streams.  All tubing and valves are made of 316 stainless steel. The tubing will be visually inspected every 6 months to see if any corrosion or metal fatigue is visible and replaced if necessary.  The reactors are passivated with silcotek’s silconert 1000 process.  This improves the chemical resistance of the reactor wall.  Swagelok valve wetted parts are fluorocarbon (FKM), polyether etherketone (PEEK), or polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). 
The back pressure regulator has PEEK seals and.  PEEK has a continuous working temperature limit of 250 °C.      
Temperature ratings for the 3-way valves are all above 232 °C and 500 psig for allowable working conditions. The transfer line after the reactor and between the GC valves will be heated to approximately 200°C.

No feed can be flowing when operator enters hood. 
Normal shutdown:
1)  Reactor is to be purged with Nitrogen for a minimum of 15 minutes at 200 sccm to ensure all Feed and Products have been swept out.
2) Temperatures have to be at 50 °C or below before any work can be done.
3) Reactor tube is removed, cleaned, visually inspected, and replaced if necessary, and reloaded.
4) The 60 micron fritted VCR fitting is replaced.
5) The unit is pressure checked to a leak rate of less than 2 psi/hr.
The unit will be shutdown annually to: 
1) Test and verify all temperature alarms and response
2) Test and verify Pressure alarm and response
3) Test and retag Pressure Safety Valves every two years
4) Test and verify hood sensor and response
[bookmark: _Toc36021952]Emergency shutdown
In an emergency, the Big Red Button on the front of the control box (PLC) can be pressed by anyone resulting in a complete unit shutdown. In addition another red button is located in front of hood. This will trigger a complete shutdown of both units too.  All power is cut to the heaters and pumps.  Power is cut to the solenoid valves resulting in the nitrogen purge valve opening and the feed flows will be zeroed by the bellows valve closing.  This is a latching alarm that requires operator intervention to disable. Be sure to lower the hood sashes so that all components in the hood will be properly vented.

The guard bed locates at the liquid feed line, which uses a Nickel metal adsorbent (75-200 mL) to remove trace amounts (ppm or sub-ppm levels) of sulfur and other impurities. The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 to heat nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8°C min-1 to 180°C. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggested GHSV of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours. The heating of this section is achieved by internal guard bed temperature controller and heat tape. Upon completion of pretreatment (activation), the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid any air exposure, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature, which is also its service temperature before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
The active components of the guard bed is Nickel metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021956] Guard bed (Activation & Passivation of Copper-Zinc oxide)
The guard bed locates at the liquid feed line, which uses a copper-zinc oxide adsorbent (75-200 mL) to remove trace amounts (ppm or sub-ppm levels) of sulfur and other impurities. The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 and diluted H2 (up to 6 vol. %) at temperature up to 225 °C for best performance. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC. Upon completion of pretreatment, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature, which is also its service temperature before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed.
The active components of the guard bed, copper and zinc, are in reduced form after activation. The sulfur impurities sulfurize the metals to form copper and zinc sulfides. There are likely some metal remaining in reduced form when unloading the spent materials from the guard bed, which can be slowly oxidized in air and generate heat. Therefore, the spent guard bed materials need to be stored in water to allow the passivation of the active metal surfaces. 

[bookmark: _Toc36021957]Safety concerns in various scenarios
In this section, we address what if scenarios of several safety concerns such as if (1) reactor leaks at *the inlet/outlet fittings, (2) hood malfunctions (3) temperature and flow controllers fail.
[bookmark: _Toc36021958]Hood malfunctions
The fume hood where the reactor system is housed has a sensor and in the event the hood malfunctions or functions below 70% capacity, the total reactor system will automatically be shut down.
[bookmark: _Toc36021959]Leaks at reactor inlet/outlet fitting
In the event a leak occurs through the reactor fittings, the feed and/or products may escape in the hood via approximately 200 °C-heated zone.  As during the normal operation the unconverted feed gas and products escape to atmosphere, the gases will continue to escape to hood/atmosphere until the problem is fixed.
As a precaution hood sash remains closed during operation and operator entry is prohibited when feed gases are flowing.
[bookmark: _Toc36021960]Temperature and flow control fail
Temperature falling, resulting in cooling, poses no safety risks.  If C6 and higher molecules are prevalent, a plug could occur in a cold line.  Pressure alarms and relief valves would render this safe.  A high temperature in the reactor would be caught by redundant temperature alarms; one internally and one in the oven wall.
Since hydrocarbon and air cannot mix in the reactor, flow control fail will not result in a flammable mix in the reactor.  Maximum flow is 300 sccm on the both flow controllers (High pressure N2 line).  If failure results in no flow, no safety consequence will be seen.  If N2 supply is disabled, all bellows valves will fail safe resulting in them closing and shutting off H2, C2H6 and CH4 and/or C3H8 mix.
[bookmark: _Toc36021961]Waste collection
Unreacted material and products will be collected in a container and vented to the hood.
The spent guard bed adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted air before being unloaded to a waste container for proper disposal. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021962]Unit Operation
[bookmark: _Toc36021963]Introduction
Unit leak testing, pre-experiment leak testing, unit shut down and alarm procedures, reactor loading and unloading are described in this chapter.
[bookmark: _Toc36021964]Leak testing
Leak testing for the reactor system will be conducted before each reactor run. Up-stream lines such as nitrogen, hydrogen and air will be leak tested annually and the results will be recorded in the unit safety logbook. 
The following steps should be performed before each reactor run. Close V-117, V148 and V-217, V248 on units 1 and 2 respectively. Pressure up with high pressure Nitrogen to 280 psig (but less than 300 psig to avoid an alarm). Monitor pressure on the pressure transducer readout for at least 30 min. Leak rate should be <2 psi/hr.  If pressure change <2 psi/hr, then the reactor is leak proofed.
[bookmark: _Toc36021965]Testing shutdown systems
Reactor Furnace High Temperature Shutdown (semi-annually)
If reactor furnace zone temperature exceeds the limit temperature, the power to the furnace zone is automatically set to zero.  The power to that furnace zone will restart only when the operator acknowledges the temperature shutdown and resets the furnace temperature.
Check for proper response (unit zone shutdown and latch) with a thermocouple signal generator.
Heat Tape and valve heater (semi-annually)
If the pre-heater temperature exceeds the limit temperature the power to the unit shuts down.  The power to heating tape will restart only when the operator acknowledges the temperature shutdown and resets the temperature. Check that the unit shuts down.
Spring-loaded safety devices (Every two years)
All spring-loaded relief valves on feed lines and reactor relief valves will be tested and reset.
Hood Function (semi-annually)
The solenoid valve sensors will monitor the continuous air suction in the hood. If hood flow is reduced by 30% or more, the unit will go into a latching shutdown.
Check that the solenoid valve sensor is functional. 
Pressure Transducers (semi-annually)
Electronic pressure transducers will monitor pressure, and will alarm at 300 psig.  Response is a complete latching shutdown. Check that alarm set point and response is functional.
Guard bed pretreatment (Nickel metal)
The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 to heat nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8°C min-1 to 180°C. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggested GHSV of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours. The heating of this section is achieved by internal guard bed temperature controller and heat tape. Upon completion of pretreatment (activation), the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid any air exposure, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature while purging with N2 for 30 minutes to allow H2-free environment, prior to place in service and before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed. 
Guard bed pretreatment (Copper-zinc)
The copper-zinc guard bed material needs to be pretreated with diluted H2 (up to 6 vol% in N2) before service. The pretreatment procedure requires temperature ramp and H2 concentration ramp, which is detailed in SOP. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC. The copper-zinc adsorbent is expected to last for months at service temperature (room temperature) upon completion of the pretreatment.
Guard bed discharge
The guard bed need to be isolated from the LPG stream, depressurized to ambient pressure, and purged with N2 for 30 min before unloading. The spent guard bed adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted air before being unloaded to a waste container for proper disposal.
[bookmark: _Toc36021966]Reactor loading procedure
Use proper personal protective equipment during catalyst grinding, sieving and loading.  Nitrile gloves, lab coat and safety glasses.  If operator requires respirator to load reactor, then other personnel in the lab must be notified to stay away from loading area also operator must go through the respirator fit test annually to get approval of respirator use. Invert and place (cleaned) tube reactor on vice. Layer into reactor tube the following: quartz wool, SiC, sized catalyst, SiC, quartz wool and gasket filter. Place and tighten VCR fittings. Install the loaded reactor in the reactor system and reactor inlet and outlet lines to reactor.
[bookmark: _Toc36021967]Unit Start-up and Run
As indicated in section 4.2, a leak test will be performed after each catalyst change-out.  If no leak is found, the unit will be started-up by following the procedure given below.  
Unit will be heated under nitrogen flow for a minimum of 30 minutes.  This will thoroughly purge the unit of any air as total unit volume of tubing and empty reactor is approximately 60 cm3 (60 sccm for a minimum of 30 minutes). H2 and C feed will be added to the feed stream and Nitrogen removed if desired. After H2 and C, the unit will be purged with Nitrogen for a minimum of 600 cm3. This will thoroughly purge the unit of any flammable or toxic gas in the system.
[bookmark: _Toc36021968]Unit operation
Unit can be unattended during operation. No changes to the unit (other than an alarm shutdown) will take place without an operator present. No work will be permitted inside the hood while any reactor is running or feed is flowing.
[bookmark: _Toc36021969]Normal unit shutdown
All unit shutdowns will involve a Nitrogen purge at the end of minimum 600 cm3 to remove any residual feeds or products.  See section 4.5

For an emergency unit shutdown push the Big Red Button on the front of the control box.  This results in a complete unit shutdown with a N2 purge.
[bookmark: _Toc36021971]Pre-treatment of nickel-based guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
Activation of the nickel guard bed

1. Switch three-way valve V114 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow H2/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069.
2. Begin flowing N2 to heat the nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8ºC min-1 to 180 ºC. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggest Gas Hourly Space Velocity of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1.
3. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours.
4. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service.
5. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
Pre-treatment of copper-zinc guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
This procedure is designed to reduce a bed of Cu-Zn adsorbent in approximately two (2) days. Higher or lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) will result in shorter or longer reduction times. The recommended gas flow (H2 + N2) should be no less than 5 mLgas mLbed-1 min-1 to insure good gas distribution and reaction efficiency.
1. Preheat the bed with 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1, gradually bringing the inlet temperature up to 150°C during a 3-hour period. The N2 flow should be maintained at this rate throughout the reduction step.
2. Begin dosing H2 at 1 % by volume by adding 0.05 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1 to the N2. This should cause a moderate exotherm. Holding the H2 concentration at 1 vol. %, gradually bring the inlet temperature up to 180°C during a one hour period.
3. Hold the 1 vol. % H2 concentration and the 180°C inlet temperature for another 8 hours for the initial stage of reduction to be completed at the conditions selected. The "hot-spot" should have travelled all the way through the bed during this time. Else continue until the “hot-spot” has passed through the bed. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225 °C.
4. Increase the H2 concentration to 2 % by volume (0.1 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue feeding the 2 vol. % mixture for 4 - 6 hours, maintaining the inlet temperature at 180°C. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225°C.
5. Increase the H2 concentration to 4 % by volume (0.2 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue at 4 vol. % H2 for 4 hours. During this step, slowly increase the inlet temperature to 200°C without allowing the bed temperatures to exceed 225°C.
6. Finally, increase the H2 concentration to 6 % by volume (3 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), increase inlet temperature to 215 – 225°C and hold for one hour at this temperature to complete the reduction. The production of water at the outlet should have gradually decreased to near zero at this point. Additionally, the hydrogen levels at the outlet of the bed should be close to the inlet hydrogen levels.
7. Stop the H2 flow and cool slowly with at least 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1 at a cooling rate not in excess of 50 °C h-1, until the bed temperatures reaches service temperature (200–250 °C). The catalyst is now activated and must not be allowed to contact air. Maintain under inert gas until put in service.
8. Turn TW-68 to keep the pretreatment gases from entering the guard bed. Set TW 64, 67, 69 & 65 to route the LPG feed to the guard bed or bypassing the guard bed as needed.
Empty the guard bed
	The active components of the guard bed is Nickel or Copper metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
1. Switch three-way valve V115 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow Air/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069 and make sure that c4 liquid feed is bypassed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 on liquid feed page 3.
2. Depressurize the guard bed to ambient pressure by tuning TW-69;
3. Turn TW-68 & TW-67 & Purge the guard bed with hot N2 (5 mLgas mLbed min-1) at 150 ºC for 30 min to remove all the hydrocarbons.
4. Slowly add 1% air to the flowing N2 and allow any exotherm to pass through the media by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h).
5. Increase the air to 2%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
6. Increase the air to 4%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
7. Increase the air to 10%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
8. At this point the media should be passivated enough to handle safely after it has been cooled to ambient temperature.
9. Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the used adsorbent to a waste container inside the hood and labeled properly for disposal.

[bookmark: _Toc517337537]Empty degasser
The liquid-gas separators at the reactor downstream have to be emptied on a weekly basis or as needed. Operation must be done when the hood is working to allow sufficient exhaust:
1. Ensure the hood flow is sufficient;
2. Open BV-06,07 and slowly open NV-03, NV-L02;
3. Close NV-03,NV-L02 soon after liquid is visible in the Teflon tubing;
4. Close BV-07,06;
Unit maintenance
Unit should be depressurized and purged and all components should be at room temperature before any maintenance is performed. If electrical work is to be done, the unit is to be de-energized.  If the component is plugged in, then unplugging is sufficient to de-energize.  If the unit is hardwired, then breaker LF xx is to be locked out and tagged out according to STC-H policies.
All maintenance should be recorded in the unit logbook.

The auto ignition temperatures of several possible products are below the reactor shutdown temperature. This process will take place under nitrogen and hydrogen. Thus, the compounds will not ignite. 
[bookmark: _Toc517169563]Regeneration mode
Catalyst regeneration is to be performed via a few different methods: via 1). Hydrogen stripping to remove soft coke, 2). Mixed feed containing hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture (methane, ethane, and trace amount of propane), and 3). Diluted air to remove hard coke.  As mentioned previously, the typical composition of the mixed feed gas is hydrogen ~74%, methane ~19%, and ethane ~7% with trace amount of propane~0.01%. 
The unit has the capability to regenerate the catalyst with air. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the formation of flammable mixture by feeding hydrogen/hydrocarbon together with diluted air. Our valve position prevent us from mixing flammable mixture of H2 with Air gases. We can feed Nitrogen with either flammables or Air. 
This unit already has a PLC programmed for flammability shutdown for mixture of pure oxygen and n-butane which is safer than mixing air with n-butane. For detailed flammability PLC shutdown logic, please refer to the HAZOP document for the oxidative cracking of butane project. As an additional reference, the graph with limits of flammability of butane in mixtures of air in nitrogen, and of air, is shown below.  
Regeneration steps are as follow - hydrocarbon and hydrogen flows are manually disabled by stopping flows in respective MFCs. Start 5-min N2 purge at 300 sccm at ambient pressure, which is achieved by making the reactor outlet bypassing backpressure regulator. This will prevent the formation of a flammable mixture. Only after N2 purge, stop ball valve V117 of Rx1 & switch three-way valve V115 for reactor 1 and V215 for reactor 2 manually to direct flow from hydrogen/HC/N2 to air/N2. Once regeneration is completed, the catalyst will be reduced in the presence of hydrogen at approximately 400 °C at 100 sccm for 2 hours.  Following actions in Table 16, which uses Reactor 1 as an example manually.

[bookmark: _Toc36021937]Introduction
Hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis processes convert various C4 feedstocks (e.g., n-butane/iso-butane, pentane, pentene, etc.) into light paraffin gases (LPG, primarily ethane and propane), which can then be used as a feedstock for light olefins (propylene and ethylene). 
C4H10 + H2 → C2H6 + C3H8
The objective of the proposed process is to investigate long-term deactivation, life-time study and regeneration of deactivated catalysts (zeolite, zeolite-like materials, or metal oxides). 
A reactor system consisting of two reactors has been retrofitted to test long-term performance of different solid catalysts and subsequent regeneration. The reactor feed for the process consists of high-pressure hydrogen (350 psi) and co-feed mixture of hydrogen, ethane (325 psig), methane and   propane (325 psig) from independent cylinders in bay 15 outside the building. A pressurized cylinder of liquid C4 located in the flammable cylinder cabinet feeds two Bronkhorst mini Cori flow liquid MFCs (flow range: 0.01 to 20 g/h (precision 0.5%)) inside the hood. The liquid C4 feed from the liquid MFC will be vaporized before being mixed with the hydrogen feed on a 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2 basis. Based on the literature, the reactor effluent or product stream may contain C1-C4 paraffin’s, small amounts of C2-C6 olefins, and small quantities of aromatics. 
Typical hydrocracking catalysts are composed of an acidic support and a metal, which work together to give the catalysts dual cracking and hydrogenation capabilities. Common supports include zeolites (e.g., modified ZSM-5), zeolite-type catalysts, and metal oxides. Metals active for hydrogenation include Pt, Pd, Ni-W, and Co-Mo, among others. The catalysts will generally be of the solid acid types, such as acidic zeolites (ZSM, USY, beta, mordenite) modified with noble or base metals. It is possible that catalysts consisting of noble or base metals supported on typical oxide supports (alumina, silica, titania, magnesia) will also be used. 
Typical hydrogenolysis catalysts are composed of supported monometallic or bimetallic catalysts. Common supports include metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, etc.), zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, NaY, etc.,), and zeolite-type catalysts. Metals active for hydrogenolysis include Pt, Ir, Rh, and Ru, among others.
Typical test conditions for deactivation typically include temperatures between RT-600 °C and high pressures between ambient pressure-280 psig. Typical test conditions for regeneration of spent catalysts include temperature 300-500 °C with 0.5 % of air in nitrogen at ambient pressure. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021938]Feed and Reaction Conditions
The reactor feed will be 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
Mixed feed line (SP-81) which contains hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. The typical mixed feed composition includes approximately ~ 74 % hydrogen, ~ 19 % methane, ~ 7 % ethane and trace amount of propane ~ 0.01 %. 
The high-pressure hydrogen line and the house high-pressure nitrogen line are regulated down to 350 psig before the mass flow controllers; the flow controllers for these lines (0-350 sccm for H2 and N2, 0-300 sccm for N2, 0-200 sccm for mixed feed) are calibrated for their respective gases. The hydrocarbon cylinder (butane, e.g.) is housed in the lab in a vented cylinder cabinet, fitted with a sprinkler head. The butane cylinder contains a dip-tube and helium blanket, and is fed via a dedicated cylinder, which is located in blue cabinet next to C4 cylinder. The feed gas pressures and others used for the GC are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 details the operating conditions for this reactor setup.

[bookmark: _Toc36021940]Catalyst
Zeolite or metal-oxide catalysts with a metal active for hydrogenation have been reported to be active for converting alkanes into LPG. A typical catalyst is platinum-loaded ZSM-5. Various modified ZSM-5 and alumina/silica are the two groups of catalyst that were studied for this reaction.  We will be testing potential literature catalysts and new catalysts from the two groups and similar types of catalysts.
The catalyst powder will be pressed and then sieved to 20-40 mesh before loading into the reactor. The catalyst loading will range between 0.1-10 g, typically 1 g catalyst. The team has to review the MSDS and health, safety and environmental hazards of chemicals used for catalyst preparation.
[bookmark: _Toc36021941]Safety concerns 
A major safety concern is the flammability of H2 and the C4 feedstock. In addition, small quantities of aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) may be present in the product stream depending on the type of catalyst used.  
The flammability limits of hydrogen are 4-74% in air; it is also a simple asphyxiant.  Hydrogen cylinders are located outside the building on the cylinder pad in bay 15.  Six pack hydrogen cylinder with regulator is used to continuously feed the H2 feed.  
The flammability limits of butane are 1.86-8.41% in air. Other possible feeds (e.g., isobuane, isobutene, etc.) have similar flammability limits. C4 will be fed from a pressurized cylinder with a helium blanket placed in a flammable cylinder cabinet. Refer to Table 14 under Section 5.5 for detailed flammability limits for methane, ethane and propane in air. 
The spent catalysts in the reactor may be treated with air for regeneration. The formation of a flammable mixture between air and H2/hydrocarbon is prevented by updating the flammability safety calculation in PLC to air. Once % HC (butane) is inside the flammable region (LFL×90% < %HC < UFL×110%), the unit will be in alarm and shut down as discussed in Section 2.7 Safety Control System (Table 10). In addition, there are three-way valves (V115, V215 for R1 and R2, respectively) that prevent mixing hydrogen with air simultaneously. Reactors will be purged with N2 before and after regeneration. 
As mentioned earlier, the reactor product stream may contain a small amount of benzene, a known carcinogen.  Operator exposure to the product stream is potentially harmful.  Operator entry in the hood is prohibited when feed is flowing to either unit. The entire process will take place inside the hood and will be leak checked prior to each run. Handling of feed and liquid products will require proper PPE as described in a later section. 
Table 4 below shows the physical properties of the feed and possible products. See Section 5 Industrial hygiene for more information on physical properties of feed and expected effluent.
The operation of the reactor is unattended.  Simultaneous malfunction of the hood and a reactor fitting or valve leak could allow escape of hydrocarbons into the lab. To handle this scenario, the hood function will be monitored continuously such that if the air flow in the hood falls below 70% of the normal, the unit shuts down in latching mode. The unit will restart only when the operator acknowledges the hood shutdown and resets all sensor monitoring.

[bookmark: _Toc36021942]Unit Description
[bookmark: _Toc36021943]Reactor description
The reactor is a 1/2” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel with VCR fittings.  The ½” O.D. x .049” wall thickness stainless steel tubing has a pressure rating of 3700 psig at a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C.  The allowable working pressure rating at elevated temperatures for this tubing is 2923 psig at 426 °C and 2812 psig at 537°C.  It is anticipated this process will screen catalysts at RT – 600 °C. 
The reactor tube is fitted with connections to accept S.S. ½” fittings and reduced to 1/4” fittings and tubing outside the furnace.  The reactor is fitted internally with a 1/8” seven-point thermocouple probe.  There is an internal thermocouple within each of the two heating zones that has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.  The additional points are to monitor the catalyst bed and reactor temperature profile.  The thermocouple is 316 stainless steel.  Reactors will be visually inspected for evidence of corrosion or fatigue after every run and replaced as necessary or at least every 6 months.
Reactor temperature is controlled by a 15” two-zone Applied Test System (ATS) clam shell furnace.  The furnace has a maximum temperature rating of 1100 °C. The furnace consists of two zones, each 6 inches long.  No reactor fittings are located inside the furnace; the top reactor fitting is 4 inches above the heated zone and the bottom reactor fitting is 4 inches below the heated zone.  Each furnace zone is controlled by an independent thermocouple in the furnace wall.  The two zones are independent with their own latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C. In addition, as stated above, one internal thermocouple in the reactor lined up with each zone has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.
In addition, 1/4” and 3/8” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel can also be used as reactors by swapping the ½” reactor. The pressure ratings of reactors with different O.D. over a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C are presented below in Table 5.

*Pressure in psig
Internal thermocouples are used for a ½” O.D. reactor alone as the smaller reactor diameters do not have enough room to accommodate the 1/8” thermo-well. 
Heat tapes associated with each unit are for pre-heating the feed, and keeping products heated to the GC sampling valve after the reactor. The heating tapes on each of the feed lines have a maximum rating 720 °C.  They will be operated at a maximum of 250 °C and will be controlled with a PID controller using a K thermocouple mounted on the tubing surface. The heat tapes have a unit shutdown latching alarm set at 300 °C.
Reactor pressure is anticipated to be at approximately 100 psig; however, a backpressure regulator (BPR-R101 and BPR-R201 respectively on reactors 1 and 2 with a pressure range of 0-500 psig) will allow catalyst testing at pressures up to 300 psig.  The readout for the reactor pressure is located upstream of the reactor and will be via a 0-300 (PT-111) and 0-300 psig (PT-211) range process strain gauges connected to a digital readout on reactor 1 and 2 respectively.  The strain gauge generates a 4-20 milliamp signal that is calibrated in the corresponding pressure range.  The digital readout connects to the alarm box which is set to alarm at 300 psig.  A 0-600 psig dial gauge is also present as additional pressure readout on each reactor feed line.  If pressure exceeds the alarm set point (280 psig), the unit will shut down (latching).  There is also a pressure safety valve (PRV-111 and PRV-211 on reactors 1 and 2 respectively) before the reactor, and on each feed line, set to relieve at 400 psig. High-pressure nitrogen will be used for leak testing at 300 psig.
Hereinafter, unit shutdown means that power is cut from all furnace heaters, heat tapes and all solenoid valve including zero the flow on all the MFCs. It also includes zeroing the flow on the liquid MFCs to stop hydrocarbon feed from flowing. The bellows valves on the H2 fail close meaning flow is cut off, and the Nitrogen bellows valves fail open (except for the case where unit shutdown is triggered by pressure alarm) allowing purge flow through the reactor.  Each unit has its own shutdown independent of the other reactor. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021944]Temperature control and alarms
Temperature control is done by the ABB 700F Freelance PLC, through a set of solid state relays on the system.  The system is designed to monitor High, Sensor Break, and Loop Break alarms and display alerts.  Transfer line alarms will shut down only the individual transfer line output.  Temperature alarms on either zone of a reactor furnace or the catalyst bed will stop output for both zones of that furnace, change all of the mass flow controller set points to zero, the nitrogen purge valves will open and an alarm indicator will appear on the control system screen.  All of these alarms are latching.  
The universal transmitters, PR 4116, are configured as separate temperature alarm units.  They are independent of the ABB control system and receive the thermocouple inputs directly. They can also convert the thermocouple input to a voltage or current output, which we send to the ABB control system for monitoring and data logging.  The PR 4116s are equipped with relays which initiate shutdown actions via separate solid state relays. 
Thermocouple being inside or outside side of catalyst bed are not affecting temperature control and alarms system in fact thermocouple outside of bed will have quicker response or closer to furnace temperature. The temperature alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 6.

The ABB control system will display the reactor pressures. The Pressure Alarms are controlled by the universal transmitters, PR 4116.  The alarm units will shut down a reactor in case of high pressure. The sensors for the system are Omega pressure transducers (PT111 & PT211).  The PR4116 units retransmit the input received from the transducers to the ABB control system for display and data logging. 
There are also spring-loaded pressure relief valves, PRV111 and PRV211, which are set to 400 psig.  These valves are a fail-safe, in the event that the pressure transducers or the safety components fail. The pressure alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 10.

Once reactor is plugged and pressurized, manual tree-way valve V116, V150 (Reactor 1) and V216, V250 (Reactor 2) will be used to relief the pressure in the reactors.
[bookmark: _Toc513205141]Utilities:  Power & Ventilation
The ABB control system and PR4116 alarm units will be connected to an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) so that the whole logic system, except for the heaters, will remain powered in case of a temporary loss of facility power.  The UPS will provide 4.5 minutes of 120V AC.  In an extended power outage, the PR 4116 alarm units will fail-safe, cutting power to all heaters and stopping all feeds.  After restoration of power, they will need to be reset to resume heating and flow. [Latch]
The unit is equipped with a Hood Flow Sensor which will sense a loss of ventilation.  This sensor is connected to a PR4116 universal transmitter, and will initiate a total shutdown of both reactors on a loss of ventilation with maximum delay of 30 seconds.  When normal ventilation resumes, the alarm unit will have to be reset in order to resume operation of the unit.

Products are expected to be in gas phase predominantly.  Possible effluent components are unreacted H2, and C1–C6 Paraffins, olefins, and aromatics.  The higher carbon compounds (> C6) are not expected, but are possible.  All will be taken into account for safety and analytical reasons. Any effluent condensate will be collected in knockout pot and the remaining gas will be vented to the hood. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021948]Reactor sampling and analytical
After the reaction section, the flow of material is directed away from the reactor and towards the analysis section. Immediately after leaving the reactor the pressure and temperature of the stream is measured, after which the gas is passed through a heated back-pressure regulator before being directed into a Valco sampling valve. After leaving this valve the flow is directed to the GC or the knockout pot. The entire analytical system after the reactor requires heat input to keep the products from having the possibility to condense. Therefore, all lines are heat traced after the reactor to prevent such condensation.
The GC is equipped with one FID (hydrogen and air as flame and helium as a carrier gases) and one TCD (Argon as carrier gas).

Wetted parts of the system are all compatible with expected and possible components of the feed and effluent streams.  All tubing and valves are made of 316 stainless steel. The tubing will be visually inspected every 6 months to see if any corrosion or metal fatigue is visible and replaced if necessary.  The reactors are passivated with silcotek’s silconert 1000 process.  This improves the chemical resistance of the reactor wall.  Swagelok valve wetted parts are fluorocarbon (FKM), polyether etherketone (PEEK), or polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). 
The back pressure regulator has PEEK seals and.  PEEK has a continuous working temperature limit of 250 °C.      
Temperature ratings for the 3-way valves are all above 232 °C and 500 psig for allowable working conditions. The transfer line after the reactor and between the GC valves will be heated to approximately 200°C.

No feed can be flowing when operator enters hood. 
Normal shutdown:
1)  Reactor is to be purged with Nitrogen for a minimum of 15 minutes at 200 sccm to ensure all Feed and Products have been swept out.
2) Temperatures have to be at 50 °C or below before any work can be done.
3) Reactor tube is removed, cleaned, visually inspected, and replaced if necessary, and reloaded.
4) The 60 micron fritted VCR fitting is replaced.
5) The unit is pressure checked to a leak rate of less than 2 psi/hr.
The unit will be shutdown annually to: 
1) Test and verify all temperature alarms and response
2) Test and verify Pressure alarm and response
3) Test and retag Pressure Safety Valves every two years
4) Test and verify hood sensor and response
[bookmark: _Toc36021952]Emergency shutdown
In an emergency, the Big Red Button on the front of the control box (PLC) can be pressed by anyone resulting in a complete unit shutdown. In addition another red button is located in front of hood. This will trigger a complete shutdown of both units too.  All power is cut to the heaters and pumps.  Power is cut to the solenoid valves resulting in the nitrogen purge valve opening and the feed flows will be zeroed by the bellows valve closing.  This is a latching alarm that requires operator intervention to disable. Be sure to lower the hood sashes so that all components in the hood will be properly vented.

The zeolite powder will be pressed and then sized to 20-40 mesh before loading into the reactor. 
The reactor will be loaded with 0.1-10 g catalyst, typically 1 g catalyst. Inert material, such as SiC, will be added to fill the void volume in the reactor.
[bookmark: _Toc36021955] Guard bed (Activation & Passivation of Nickel metal)
The guard bed locates at the liquid feed line, which uses a Nickel metal adsorbent (75-200 mL) to remove trace amounts (ppm or sub-ppm levels) of sulfur and other impurities. The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 to heat nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8°C min-1 to 180°C. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggested GHSV of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours. The heating of this section is achieved by internal guard bed temperature controller and heat tape. Upon completion of pretreatment (activation), the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid any air exposure, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature, which is also its service temperature before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
The active components of the guard bed is Nickel metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021956] Guard bed (Activation & Passivation of Copper-Zinc oxide)
The guard bed locates at the liquid feed line, which uses a copper-zinc oxide adsorbent (75-200 mL) to remove trace amounts (ppm or sub-ppm levels) of sulfur and other impurities. The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 and diluted H2 (up to 6 vol. %) at temperature up to 225 °C for best performance. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC. Upon completion of pretreatment, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature, which is also its service temperature before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed.
The active components of the guard bed, copper and zinc, are in reduced form after activation. The sulfur impurities sulfurize the metals to form copper and zinc sulfides. There are likely some metal remaining in reduced form when unloading the spent materials from the guard bed, which can be slowly oxidized in air and generate heat. Therefore, the spent guard bed materials need to be stored in water to allow the passivation of the active metal surfaces. 

[bookmark: _Toc36021957]Safety concerns in various scenarios
In this section, we address what if scenarios of several safety concerns such as if (1) reactor leaks at *the inlet/outlet fittings, (2) hood malfunctions (3) temperature and flow controllers fail.
[bookmark: _Toc36021958]Hood malfunctions
The fume hood where the reactor system is housed has a sensor and in the event the hood malfunctions or functions below 70% capacity, the total reactor system will automatically be shut down.
[bookmark: _Toc36021959]Leaks at reactor inlet/outlet fitting
In the event a leak occurs through the reactor fittings, the feed and/or products may escape in the hood via approximately 200 °C-heated zone.  As during the normal operation the unconverted feed gas and products escape to atmosphere, the gases will continue to escape to hood/atmosphere until the problem is fixed.
As a precaution hood sash remains closed during operation and operator entry is prohibited when feed gases are flowing.
[bookmark: _Toc36021960]Temperature and flow control fail
Temperature falling, resulting in cooling, poses no safety risks.  If C6 and higher molecules are prevalent, a plug could occur in a cold line.  Pressure alarms and relief valves would render this safe.  A high temperature in the reactor would be caught by redundant temperature alarms; one internally and one in the oven wall.
Since hydrocarbon and air cannot mix in the reactor, flow control fail will not result in a flammable mix in the reactor.  Maximum flow is 300 sccm on the both flow controllers (High pressure N2 line).  If failure results in no flow, no safety consequence will be seen.  If N2 supply is disabled, all bellows valves will fail safe resulting in them closing and shutting off H2, C2H6 and CH4 and/or C3H8 mix.
[bookmark: _Toc36021961]Waste collection
Unreacted material and products will be collected in a container and vented to the hood.
The spent guard bed adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted air before being unloaded to a waste container for proper disposal. 
[bookmark: _Toc36021962]Unit Operation
[bookmark: _Toc36021963]Introduction
Unit leak testing, pre-experiment leak testing, unit shut down and alarm procedures, reactor loading and unloading are described in this chapter.
[bookmark: _Toc36021964]Leak testing
Leak testing for the reactor system will be conducted before each reactor run. Up-stream lines such as nitrogen, hydrogen and air will be leak tested annually and the results will be recorded in the unit safety logbook. 
The following steps should be performed before each reactor run. Close V-117, V148 and V-217, V248 on units 1 and 2 respectively. Pressure up with high pressure Nitrogen to 280 psig (but less than 300 psig to avoid an alarm). Monitor pressure on the pressure transducer readout for at least 30 min. Leak rate should be <2 psi/hr.  If pressure change <2 psi/hr, then the reactor is leak proofed.
[bookmark: _Toc36021965]Testing shutdown systems
Reactor Furnace High Temperature Shutdown (semi-annually)
If reactor furnace zone temperature exceeds the limit temperature, the power to the furnace zone is automatically set to zero.  The power to that furnace zone will restart only when the operator acknowledges the temperature shutdown and resets the furnace temperature.
Check for proper response (unit zone shutdown and latch) with a thermocouple signal generator.
Heat Tape and valve heater (semi-annually)
If the pre-heater temperature exceeds the limit temperature the power to the unit shuts down.  The power to heating tape will restart only when the operator acknowledges the temperature shutdown and resets the temperature. Check that the unit shuts down.
Spring-loaded safety devices (Every two years)
All spring-loaded relief valves on feed lines and reactor relief valves will be tested and reset.
Hood Function (semi-annually)
The solenoid valve sensors will monitor the continuous air suction in the hood. If hood flow is reduced by 30% or more, the unit will go into a latching shutdown.
Check that the solenoid valve sensor is functional. 
Pressure Transducers (semi-annually)
Electronic pressure transducers will monitor pressure, and will alarm at 300 psig.  Response is a complete latching shutdown. Check that alarm set point and response is functional.
Guard bed pretreatment (Nickel metal)
The guard bed adsorbent needs to be pretreated with N2 to heat nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8°C min-1 to 180°C. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggested GHSV of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours. The heating of this section is achieved by internal guard bed temperature controller and heat tape. Upon completion of pretreatment (activation), the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid any air exposure, the guard bed is cooled to room temperature while purging with N2 for 30 minutes to allow H2-free environment, prior to place in service and before exposure to the hydrocarbon feed. 
Guard bed pretreatment (Copper-zinc)
The copper-zinc guard bed material needs to be pretreated with diluted H2 (up to 6 vol% in N2) before service. The pretreatment procedure requires temperature ramp and H2 concentration ramp, which is detailed in SOP. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC. The copper-zinc adsorbent is expected to last for months at service temperature (room temperature) upon completion of the pretreatment.
Guard bed discharge
The guard bed need to be isolated from the LPG stream, depressurized to ambient pressure, and purged with N2 for 30 min before unloading. The spent guard bed adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted air before being unloaded to a waste container for proper disposal.
[bookmark: _Toc36021966]Reactor loading procedure
Use proper personal protective equipment during catalyst grinding, sieving and loading.  Nitrile gloves, lab coat and safety glasses.  If operator requires respirator to load reactor, then other personnel in the lab must be notified to stay away from loading area also operator must go through the respirator fit test annually to get approval of respirator use. Invert and place (cleaned) tube reactor on vice. Layer into reactor tube the following: quartz wool, SiC, sized catalyst, SiC, quartz wool and gasket filter. Place and tighten VCR fittings. Install the loaded reactor in the reactor system and reactor inlet and outlet lines to reactor.
[bookmark: _Toc36021967]Unit Start-up and Run
As indicated in section 4.2, a leak test will be performed after each catalyst change-out.  If no leak is found, the unit will be started-up by following the procedure given below.  
Unit will be heated under nitrogen flow for a minimum of 30 minutes.  This will thoroughly purge the unit of any air as total unit volume of tubing and empty reactor is approximately 60 cm3 (60 sccm for a minimum of 30 minutes). H2 and C feed will be added to the feed stream and Nitrogen removed if desired. After H2 and C, the unit will be purged with Nitrogen for a minimum of 600 cm3. This will thoroughly purge the unit of any flammable or toxic gas in the system.
[bookmark: _Toc36021968]Unit operation
Unit can be unattended during operation. No changes to the unit (other than an alarm shutdown) will take place without an operator present. No work will be permitted inside the hood while any reactor is running or feed is flowing.
[bookmark: _Toc36021969]Normal unit shutdown

The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
Activation of the nickel guard bed

1. Switch three-way valve V114 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow H2/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069.
2. Begin flowing N2 to heat the nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8ºC min-1 to 180 ºC. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggest Gas Hourly Space Velocity of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1.
3. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours.
4. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service.
5. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
Pre-treatment of copper-zinc guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
This procedure is designed to reduce a bed of Cu-Zn adsorbent in approximately two (2) days. Higher or lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) will result in shorter or longer reduction times. The recommended gas flow (H2 + N2) should be no less than 5 mLgas mLbed-1 min-1 to insure good gas distribution and reaction efficiency.
1. Preheat the bed with 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1, gradually bringing the inlet temperature up to 150°C during a 3-hour period. The N2 flow should be maintained at this rate throughout the reduction step.
2. Begin dosing H2 at 1 % by volume by adding 0.05 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1 to the N2. This should cause a moderate exotherm. Holding the H2 concentration at 1 vol. %, gradually bring the inlet temperature up to 180°C during a one hour period.
3. Hold the 1 vol. % H2 concentration and the 180°C inlet temperature for another 8 hours for the initial stage of reduction to be completed at the conditions selected. The "hot-spot" should have travelled all the way through the bed during this time. Else continue until the “hot-spot” has passed through the bed. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225 °C.
4. Increase the H2 concentration to 2 % by volume (0.1 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue feeding the 2 vol. % mixture for 4 - 6 hours, maintaining the inlet temperature at 180°C. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225°C.
5. Increase the H2 concentration to 4 % by volume (0.2 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue at 4 vol. % H2 for 4 hours. During this step, slowly increase the inlet temperature to 200°C without allowing the bed temperatures to exceed 225°C.
6. Finally, increase the H2 concentration to 6 % by volume (3 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), increase inlet temperature to 215 – 225°C and hold for one hour at this temperature to complete the reduction. The production of water at the outlet should have gradually decreased to near zero at this point. Additionally, the hydrogen levels at the outlet of the bed should be close to the inlet hydrogen levels.
7. Stop the H2 flow and cool slowly with at least 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1 at a cooling rate not in excess of 50 °C h-1, until the bed temperatures reaches service temperature (200–250 °C). The catalyst is now activated and must not be allowed to contact air. Maintain under inert gas until put in service.
8. Turn TW-68 to keep the pretreatment gases from entering the guard bed. Set TW 64, 67, 69 & 65 to route the LPG feed to the guard bed or bypassing the guard bed as needed.
Empty the guard bed
	The active components of the guard bed is Nickel or Copper metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
1. Switch three-way valve V115 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow Air/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069 and make sure that c4 liquid feed is bypassed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 on liquid feed page 3.
2. Depressurize the guard bed to ambient pressure by tuning TW-69;
3. Turn TW-68 & TW-67 & Purge the guard bed with hot N2 (5 mLgas mLbed min-1) at 150 ºC for 30 min to remove all the hydrocarbons.
4. Slowly add 1% air to the flowing N2 and allow any exotherm to pass through the media by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h).
5. Increase the air to 2%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
6. Increase the air to 4%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
7. Increase the air to 10%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
8. At this point the media should be passivated enough to handle safely after it has been cooled to ambient temperature.
9. Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the used adsorbent to a waste container inside the hood and labeled properly for disposal.

[bookmark: _Toc517337537]Empty degasser
The liquid-gas separators at the reactor downstream have to be emptied on a weekly basis or as needed. Operation must be done when the hood is working to allow sufficient exhaust:
1. Ensure the hood flow is sufficient;
2. Open BV-06,07 and slowly open NV-03, NV-L02;
3. Close NV-03,NV-L02 soon after liquid is visible in the Teflon tubing;
4. Close BV-07,06;
Unit maintenance
Unit should be depressurized and purged and all components should be at room temperature before any maintenance is performed. If electrical work is to be done, the unit is to be de-energized.  If the component is plugged in, then unplugging is sufficient to de-energize.  If the unit is hardwired, then breaker LF xx is to be locked out and tagged out according to STC-H policies.
All maintenance should be recorded in the unit logbook.

The auto ignition temperatures of several possible products are below the reactor shutdown temperature. This process will take place under nitrogen and hydrogen. Thus, the compounds will not ignite. 
[bookmark: _Toc517169563]Regeneration mode
Catalyst regeneration is to be performed via a few different methods: via 1). Hydrogen stripping to remove soft coke, 2). Mixed feed containing hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture (methane, ethane, and trace amount of propane), and 3). Diluted air to remove hard coke.  As mentioned previously, the typical composition of the mixed feed gas is hydrogen ~74%, methane ~19%, and ethane ~7% with trace amount of propane~0.01%. 
The unit has the capability to regenerate the catalyst with air. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the formation of flammable mixture by feeding hydrogen/hydrocarbon together with diluted air. Our valve position prevent us from mixing flammable mixture of H2 with Air gases. We can feed Nitrogen with either flammables or Air. 
This unit already has a PLC programmed for flammability shutdown for mixture of pure oxygen and n-butane which is safer than mixing air with n-butane. For detailed flammability PLC shutdown logic, please refer to the HAZOP document for the oxidative cracking of butane project. As an additional reference, the graph with limits of flammability of butane in mixtures of air in nitrogen, and of air, is shown below.  
Regeneration steps are as follow - hydrocarbon and hydrogen flows are manually disabled by stopping flows in respective MFCs. Start 5-min N2 purge at 300 sccm at ambient pressure, which is achieved by making the reactor outlet bypassing backpressure regulator. This will prevent the formation of a flammable mixture. Only after N2 purge, stop ball valve V117 of Rx1 & switch three-way valve V115 for reactor 1 and V215 for reactor 2 manually to direct flow from hydrogen/HC/N2 to air/N2. Once regeneration is completed, the catalyst will be reduced in the presence of hydrogen at approximately 400 °C at 100 sccm for 2 hours.  Following actions in Table 16, which uses Reactor 1 as an example manually.

[bookmark: _Toc36196285]Process overview
[bookmark: _Toc36196286]Introduction
Hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis processes convert various C4 feedstocks (e.g., n-butane/iso-butane, pentane, pentene, etc.) into light paraffin gases (primarily ethane and propane), which can then be used as a feedstock for light olefins. 
C4H10 + H2 → 2 C2H6
The objective of the proposed process is to investigate long-term deactivation, life-time study and regeneration of deactivated catalysts (zeolite and alike, or metal oxides). 
A reactor system consisting of two reactors has been retrofitted to test long-term performance of different solid catalysts and subsequent regeneration. The reactor feed for the process consists of high-pressure hydrogen (350 psi) and co-feed mixture of hydrogen, ethane (325 psig), methane and   propane (325 psig) from independent cylinders in bay 15 outside the building. A pressurized cylinder of liquid C4 located in the flammable cylinder cabinet feeds two Bronkhorst mini Cori flow liquid MFCs (flow range: 0.01 to 20 g/h (precision 0.5%)) inside the hood. The liquid C4 feed from the liquid MFC will be vaporized before being mixed with the hydrogen feed on a 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2 basis. Based on the literature, the reactor effluent or product stream may contain C1-C4 paraffins, small amounts of C2-C6 olefins, and small quantities of aromatics. 
Typical hydrocracking catalysts are composed of an acidic support and a metal, which work together to give the catalysts dual cracking and hydrogenation capabilities. Common supports include zeolites (e.g., modified ZSM-5), zeolite-type catalysts, and metal oxides. Metals active for hydrogenation include Pt, Pd, Ni-W, and Co-Mo, among others. The catalysts will generally be of the solid acid types, such as acidic zeolites (ZSM, USY, beta, mordenite) modified with noble or base metals. It is possible that catalysts consisting of noble or base metals supported on typical oxide supports (alumina, silica, titania, magnesia) will also be used. 
Typical hydrogenolysis catalysts are composed of supported monometallic or bimetallic catalysts. Common supports include metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, TiO¬2, Al2O3, etc.), zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, NaY, etc.,), and zeolite-type catalysts. Metals active for hydrogenolysis include Pt, Ir, Rh, and Ru, among others.
Typical test conditions for deactivation typically include temperatures between RT-600 °C and high pressures between ambient pressure-280 psig. Typical test conditions for regeneration of spent catalysts include temperature 300-500 °C with 0.5 % of air in nitrogen at ambient pressure.
[bookmark: _Toc36196287]Feed and Reaction Conditions
[bookmark: _Ref487628544]The reactor feed will be 1:0.1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
Mixed feed line (SP-81) which contains hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. The typical mixed feed composition includes approximately ~ 74 % hydrogen, ~ 19 % methane, ~ 7 % ethane and trace amount of propane ~ 0.01 %. 
The high-pressure hydrogen line and the house high-pressure nitrogen line are regulated down to 350 psig before the mass flow controllers; the flow controllers for these lines (0-350 sccm for H2 and N2, 0-300 sccm for N2, 0-200 sccm for mixed feed) are calibrated for their respective gases. The hydrocarbon cylinder (butane, e.g.) is housed in the lab in a vented cylinder cabinet, fitted with a sprinkler head. The butane cylinder contains a dip-tube and helium blanket, and is fed via a dedicated cylinder, which is located in blue cabinet next to C4 cylinder. The feed gas pressures and others used for the GC are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 details the operating conditions for this reactor setup.

Note: The process also generates small amount of aromatics compounds (0.2-0.6 wt. % of total feed), composing benzene, toluene, xylenes, naphthalene and other poly-aromatics.

[bookmark: _Toc36196289]Catalyst
Zeolite or metal-oxide catalysts with a metal active for hydrogenation have been reported to be active for converting alkanes into LPG. A typical catalyst is platinum-loaded ZSM-5. Various modified ZSM-5 and alumina/silica are the two groups of catalyst that were studied for this reaction.  We will be testing potential literature catalysts and new catalysts from the two groups and similar types of catalysts.
The catalyst powder will be pressed and then sieved to 20-40 mesh before loading into the reactor. The catalyst loading will range between 0.1-10 g, typically 1 g catalyst. The team has to review the MSDS and health, safety and environmental hazards of chemicals used for catalyst preparation.
[bookmark: _Ref494878095][bookmark: _Toc36196290]Safety concerns 
A major safety concern is the flammability of H2 and the C4 feedstock. In addition, small quantities of aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) may be present in the product stream depending on the type of catalyst used.  
The flammability limits of hydrogen are 4-74% in air; it is also a simple asphyxiant.  Hydrogen cylinders are located outside the building on the cylinder pad in bay 15.  Six pack hydrogen cylinder with regulator is used to continuously feed the H2 feed.  
The flammability limits of butane are 1.86-8.41% in air. Other possible feeds (e.g., isobuane, isobutene, etc.) have similar flammability limits. C4 will be fed from a pressurized cylinder with a helium blanket placed in a flammable cylinder cabinet. Refer to Table 10 under Section 3.0 for detailed flammability limits for methane, ethane and propane in air. 
The spent catalysts in the reactor may be treated with air for regeneration. The formation of a flammable mixture between air and H2/hydrocarbon is prevented by updating the flammability safety calculation in PLC to air. Once % HC (butane) is inside the flammable region (LFL×90% < %HC < UFL×110%), the unit will be in alarm and shut down as discussed in Section 2.7 Safety Control System (Table 10). In addition, there are three-way valves (V115, V215 for R1 and R2, respectively) that prevent mixing hydrogen with air simultaneously. Reactors will be purged with N2 before and after regeneration. 
As mentioned earlier, the reactor product stream may contain a small amount of benzene, a known carcinogen.  Operator exposure to the product stream is potentially harmful.  Operator entry in the hood is prohibited when feed is flowing to either unit. The entire process will take place inside the hood and will be leak checked prior to each run. Handling of feed and liquid products will require proper PPE as described in a later section. 
Table 4 below shows the physical properties of the feed and possible products. See Section 3 Industrial hygiene for more information on physical properties of feed and expected effluent.
The operation of the reactor is unattended.  Simultaneous malfunction of the hood and a reactor fitting or valve leak could allow escape of hydrocarbons into the lab. To handle this scenario, the hood function will be monitored continuously such that if the air flow in the hood falls below 70% of the normal, the unit shuts down in latching mode. The unit will restart only when the operator acknowledges the hood shutdown and resets all sensor monitoring.

[bookmark: _Toc36196291] Environmental concerns
The process generates relatively large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and highest flowrate is proposed to ensure the emission of VOCs from this project to be within our current air permit. As of June 2017, our air permit (PBR) allows 25 tons per year (tpy) of VOCs at STC-H and we currently stand at about 14 tpy.
The typical product distribution, assuming C4 is the hydrocarbon used, is 10 wt. % methane, 40 wt. % ethane, 45 wt. % propane and 5 wt. % butanes, among which propane and butanes are the VOCs requiring regulation. In the event other hydrocarbons are utilized, operators will verify the potential product slate is within the range needed to comply with VOC regulations. Our highest flow rate (25 kg/day butanes) will generate approximately 5 tpy VOCs on an unrestricted potential to emit, which will increase our emission potential to 19 tpy, which is still below the 25 tpy limit.
[bookmark: _Toc36196292]Unit description
[bookmark: _Toc36196293]Reactor description
The reactor is a 1/2” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel with VCR fittings.  The ½” O.D. x .049” wall thickness stainless steel tubing has a pressure rating of 3700 psig at a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C.  The allowable working pressure rating at elevated temperatures for this tubing is 2923 psig at 426 °C and 2812 psig at 537°C.  It is anticipated this process will screen catalysts at RT – 600 °C. 
The reactor tube is fitted with connections to accept S.S. ½” fittings and reduced to 1/4” fittings and tubing outside the furnace.  The reactor is fitted internally with a 1/8” seven-point thermocouple probe.  There is an internal thermocouple within each of the two heating zones that has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.  The additional points are to monitor the catalyst bed and reactor temperature profile.  The thermocouple is 316 stainless steel.  Reactors will be visually inspected for evidence of corrosion or fatigue after every run and replaced as necessary or at least every 6 months.
Reactor temperature is controlled by a 15” two-zone Applied Test System (ATS) clam shell furnace.  The furnace has a maximum temperature rating of 1100 °C. The furnace consists of two zones, each 6 inches long.  No reactor fittings are located inside the furnace; the top reactor fitting is 4 inches above the heated zone and the bottom reactor fitting is 4 inches below the heated zone.  Each furnace zone is controlled by an independent thermocouple in the furnace wall.  The two zones are independent with their own latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C. In addition, as stated above, one internal thermocouple in the reactor lined up with each zone has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.
In addition, 1/4” and 3/8” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel can also be used as reactors by swapping the ½” reactor.  The pressure ratings of reactors with different O.D. over a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C are presented below in Table 5.

*Pressure in psig
Internal thermocouples are used for a ½” O.D. reactor alone as the smaller reactor diameters do not have enough room to accommodate the 1/8” thermo-well. 
Heat tapes associated with each unit are for pre-heating the feed, and keeping products heated to the GC sampling valve after the reactor. The heating tapes on each of the feed lines have a maximum rating 720 °C.  They will be operated at a maximum of 250 °C and will be controlled with a PID controller using a K thermocouple mounted on the tubing surface. The heat tapes have a unit shutdown latching alarm set at 300 °C.
Reactor pressure is anticipated to be at approximately 100 psig; however, a backpressure regulator (BPR-R101 and BPR-R201 respectively on reactors 1 and 2 with a pressure range of 0-500 psig) will allow catalyst testing at pressures up to 300 psig.  The readout for the reactor pressure is located upstream of the reactor and will be via a 0-300 (PT-111) and 0-300 psig (PT-211) range process strain gauges connected to a digital readout on reactor 1 and 2 respectively.  The strain gauge generates a 4-20 milliamp signal that is calibrated in the corresponding pressure range.  The digital readout connects to the alarm box which is set to alarm at 300 psig.  A 0-600 psig dial gauge is also present as additional pressure readout on each reactor feed line.  If pressure exceeds the alarm set point (300 psig), the unit will shut down (latching).  There is also a pressure safety valve (PRV-111 and PRV-211 on reactors 1 and 2 respectively) before the reactor, and on each feed line, set to relieve at 400 psig. High-pressure nitrogen will be used for leak testing at 300 psig.
Hereinafter, unit shutdown means that power is cut from all furnace heaters, heat tapes, and solenoid valve to zero the flow on all the MFCs. It also includes zeroing the flow on the liquid MFCs to stop hydrocarbon feed from flowing. The bellows valves on the H2 fail close meaning flow is cut off, and the Nitrogen bellows valves fail open (except for the case where unit shutdown is triggered by pressure alarm) allowing purge flow through the reactor.  Each unit has its own shutdown independent of the other reactor.

Products are expected to be in gas phase predominantly.  Possible effluent components are unreacted H2, and C1–C6 Paraffins, olefins, and aromatics.  The higher carbon compounds (> C6) are not expected, but are possible.  All will be taken into account for safety and analytical reasons. Any effluent condensate will be collected in knockout bomb and the remaining gas will be vented to the hood. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196295]Reactor sampling and analytical
After the reaction section, the flow of material is directed away from the reactor and towards the analysis section. Immediately after leaving the reactor the pressure and temperature of the stream is measured, after which the gas is passed through a heated back-pressure regulator before being directed into a Valco sampling valve. After leaving this valve the flow is directed to the GC or the knockout pot. The entire analytical system train after the reactor requires heat input to keep the products from having the opportunity to condense. Therefore, all lines are heat traced after the reactor to prevent such condensation.
The GC is equipped with one FID (hydrogen and air as flame and helium as a carrier gases) and one TCD (Argon as carrier gas).

Temperature control is done by the ABB 700F Freelance PLC, through a set of solid state relays on the system.  The system is designed to monitor High, Sensor Break, and Loop Break alarms and display alerts.  Transfer line alarms will shut down only the individual transfer line output.  Temperature alarms on either zone of a reactor furnace or the catalyst bed will stop output for both zones of that furnace, change all of the mass flow controller set points to zero, the helium purge valves will open and an alarm indicator will appear on the control system screen.  All of these alarms are latching.  
The universal transmitters, PR 4116, are configured as separate temperature alarm units.  They are independent of the ABB control system and receive the thermocouple inputs directly. They can also convert the thermocouple input to a voltage or current output, which we send to the ABB control system for monitoring and data logging.  The PR 4116s are equipped with relays which initiate shutdown actions via separate solid state relays. 
Thermocouple being inside or outside side of catalyst bed are not affecting temperature control and alarms system in fact thermocouple outside of bed will have quicker response or closer to furnace temperature. The temperature alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 6 & 7.

[bookmark: _Toc36196297]Chemical compatibility
Wetted parts of the system are all compatible with expected and possible components of the feed and effluent streams.  All tubing and valves are made of 316 stainless steel. The tubing will be visually inspected every 6 months to see if any corrosion or metal fatigue is visible and replaced if necessary.  The reactors are passivated with silcotek’s silconert 1000 process.  This improves the chemical resistance of the reactor wall.  Swagelok valve wetted parts are fluorocarbon (FKM), polyether etherketone (PEEK), or polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). 
The back pressure regulator has PEEK seals and.  PEEK has a continuous working temperature limit of 250 °C.      
Temperature ratings for the 3-way valves are all above 232 °C and 500 psig for allowable working conditions. The transfer line after the reactor and between the GC valves will be heated to approximately 200°C.

The following safety information serves as only a guide. Consult current SDS’s for up-to-date and complete information on the following chemicals. This is also not a comprehensive list of chemicals to be used in the unit, and is only meant to serve as a typical example of what this unit is intended to run. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196300]Reactants
C4 (butane): Extremely flammable liquid and vapor that may be fatal if swallowed and enter the airways. May cause drowsiness or dizziness. Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects. Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.  High concentrations may cause asphyxiation. In low concentrations, may cause narcotic effects such as headache, nausea and loss of coordination. May have damaging effects on the respiratory system, central nervous system, and liver. May irritate mucous membranes and cause dry coughs. A face shield should be worn when breaking transfer connections. 
Nitrogen:  Nitrogen is a simple asphyxiant.  N2 will be used to purge reactor.  Low and high pressure house nitrogen will be used.
Hydrogen: Simple asphyxiant. Extremely flammable gas. Forms explosive mixtures with air and oxidizing agents. Steel-toed shoes and safety glasses should be worn when handling gas cylinders. High pressure hydrogen (300 psi) will be used as a reactant. 
Nickel metal: Guard bed material nickel metal is highly flammable in air. We received this material passivated by CO2. Avoid dust formation, inhalation of dust (may cause cancer by inhalation), contact with the skin (may cause an allergic skin reaction), eyes & clothing. Wear proper PPE & use engineering control devise (hood) to handle this materials. Nickel occupational exposure limits OSHA PEL 1 mg/m3; TWA value 1 mg/m3; ACIGH TLV TWA value 1.5mg/m3 Inhalable fraction.
Copper-Zinc oxides: The active components of the guard bed, copper and zinc, are in reduced, & oxidized forms after activation, respectively. The sulfur impurities sulfurize the metals to form copper and zinc sulfides. Contact with powders or dust may irritate the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Zinc oxide, Aluminium oxide & Graphite are not irritating to the skin. May cause slight irritation to the eyes. Wear proper PPE & handle this material inside the hood. Occupational exposure limit of Zinc oxide, 2 mg/m3 USA. ACGIH (TLV) TWA 5 mg/m3 USA. NIOSH. Copper oxide LD 50 Rat: > 2,500 mg/kg oral, Dermal LD 50 Rabbit: >2,000 mg/kg. Fish LC50-0.19-0.21 mg/l-96 h, EC 50-0.11-0.039 g/l-48 h.
[bookmark: _Toc36196301]Products
Ethane / Propane: Flammable gas. Gas may act as a simple asphyxiant and mild anesthetic.  Direct contact with liquid may cause skin burns.
Aromatics: Aromatics in total comprise ~5 wt. % of the products. Benzene has low acute toxicity. Chronic inhalation of benzene can cause bone marrow abnormalities, anemia, leukemia, and other blood-related disorders. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classify benzene as a human carcinogen [1–3]. Reported levels at which chronic benzene exposure causes health damage vary, but the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) set an exposure limit of 0.5 ppm for an eight-hour day and 2.5 ppm for a 15minute period [4]. The odor threshold of benzene varies among individuals, but the detection average is 60 ppm, well above the chronic exposure limit.
Naphthalene is reported to have similar toxicities. Acute exposure to high levels of naphthalene or tetralin by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact is associated with eye and respiratory inflammation. Chronic exposure to naphthalene is reported to cause cataracts and liver damage. In addition, the EPA and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies naphthalene as a possible carcinogen [2,5].
Toluene and the xylenes are less toxic and have lower odor thresholds than benzene. This combination affords sufficient warning of the presence of toluene and xylene before dangerous concentrations are reached [4].

[bookmark: _Toc516495701][bookmark: _Ref517256538]Regeneration mode
The unit has the capability to regenerate the catalyst with air. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the formation of flammable mixture by feeding hydrogen/hydrocarbon together with diluted air. Our valve position prevent us from mixing flammable mixture of H2 with Air gases. We can feed Nitrogen with either flammables or Air.
This unit already has a PLC programmed for flammability shutdown for mixture of pure oxygen and n-butane which is safer than mixing air with n-butane. For detailed flammability PLC shutdown logic, please refer to the HAZOP document for the oxidative cracking of butane project. As an additional reference, the graph with limits of flammability of butane in mixtures of air in nitrogen, and of air, is shown below.  
Regeneration steps are as follow - hydrocarbon and hydrogen flows are manually disabled by stopping flows in respective MFCs. Start 5-min N2 purge at 300 sccm at ambient pressure, which is achieved by making the reactor outlet bypassing backpressure regulator. This will prevent the formation of a flammable mixture. Only after N2 purge, stop ball valve V117 of Rx1 & switch three-way valve V115 for reactor 1 and V215 for reactor 2 manually to direct flow from hydrogen/HC/N2 to air/N2. 
Following actions in Table 11, which uses Reactor 1 as an example manually.

The reactor feed will be 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196303]Personal protective equipment
Safety glasses, long pants and long sleeves are required at all times. Lab coat is required for lab work on reactors, chemicals or catalysts.
Loading liquid feed vessel
Steel-toe shoes must be worn when changing liquid or gas cylinders.
Handling catalyst 
Lab coat, nitrile rubber gloves, safety glasses and close-toe shoes are required. Measuring and loading catalyst extrudates (precious metals loaded on zeolite and alumina binder) will be performed in open area of Lab 113. Since the catalysts are in extrudates form, the chance of dust spilling is minimal. Catalysts will be unloaded in the hood into a waste can on floor, since catalyst extrudates may be pulverized during reaction and give a higher change to generate dust.
Handling Guard bed materials
The guard bed material is Nickel metal & it’s flammable in air and therefore nickel guard bed material was passivated in CO2 as received for safe handling. As a result, the nickel beds needs to be activated in N2 or diluted H2 before use. Upon completion of activation, the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid air exposure. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. All the operation from loading to unloading needs to be performed in hood to avoid any health hazards.
The guard bed materials are copper-zinc oxide supported on alumina. Similar to zeolite-based catalysts, the guard bed material is non-toxic and non-flammable solid and hence requires similar safety measures to that for catalyst handling.
[bookmark: _Toc36196305]Heated surfaces
The reactor is not removed from the system until it is at or cooler than 50 °C.
[bookmark: _Toc36196306]Energized equipment
All equipment is de-energized before any maintenance is performed.  The unit uses 208 V and 110 V power and all electrical equipment is enclosed in grounded cases.  These cases are not opened until the power plugs are removed from the power sockets.
[bookmark: _Toc36196307]Gas/liquid cylinders under pressure
All pressurized cylinders, including LPG, hydrogen and inert gases, must be closed and capped before any movement.
[bookmark: _Toc36196308]Waste disposal
Solid and liquid waste (spent catalyst, spent inert, residue from catalyst sizing, aromatic by-products) will be accumulated in sealed containers labeled according to STC-H policies. The solid waste will be treated as hydrocarbon contaminated solids and will be disposed of by the outside vendor at the end of the program or when appropriate. The waste collected in the liquid-gas separation vessel will then be disposed of in accordance with STC-H policies and with a waste-stream number. All gloves and paper used in handling solid and liquid waste should be placed in waste containers and disposed of according to STC-H policies.
The spent nickel and copper-zinc guard-bed adsorbents need to be passivated with diluted O2 before being discharged in to the waste container for proper disposal. No hazardous reactions occurred if stored and handled as indicated.
[bookmark: _Toc36196309]Spill control
Spills of catalyst from the reactor or heavy hydrocarbons from the feed system or the liquid-gas separator after reactor can both occur. For clean-up of small spills, wear proper PPE (Nitri Solve 727, Ultraflex Nitrile 22R or equivalent gloves, eye protection, and lab coat).
In the case a spill larger than 100 ml, notify Emergency Response Team and do NOT attempt to clean up the spill on your own.

[bookmark: _Toc36196311]Safety concerns in various scenarios
In this section, we address what if scenarios of several safety concerns. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196312]Hood malfunctions
The fume hood where the reactor system is housed has a sensor and in the event the hood malfunctions or functions below 70% capacity, the total reactor system will automatically be shut down.
[bookmark: _Ref493162467][bookmark: _Toc36196313]Leaks at reactor inlet/outlet fitting
In the event a leak occurs through the reactor fittings, the feed and/or products may escape in the hood via approximately 400 °C-heated zone. As during the normal operation the unconverted feed gas and products escape to atmosphere, the gases will continue to escape to hood/atmosphere until the problem is fixed.
As a precaution hood sash remains closed during operation and operator entry is prohibited when feed gases are flowing.
Worst-case-scenario leaks of H2 and hydrocarbons
The excess flow valve (EFV) shuts off if hydrogen flow goes up to 2.3 slpm (0.0805 scfm). The calculation below describes the effectiveness of hood flow to dilute the worst case scenario H2 leak, which shows the dilution required for an H2 leak to be below LFL of 4.0% in air. The calculation shows that the dimension of control volume in the worst-case-scenario hydrogen leak.

[bookmark: _GoBack]* Max butane flowrate is the one at which the velocity fuse trips.
[bookmark: _Toc36196314]Temperature and flow control fail
Temperature falling, resulting in cooling, poses no safety risks.  If C6 and higher molecules are prevalent, a plug could occur in a cold line.  Pressure alarms and relief valves would render this safe.  A high temperature in the reactor would be caught by redundant temperature alarms; one internally and one in the oven wall.
Since hydrocarbon and air cannot mix in the reactor, flow control fail will not result in a flammable mix in the reactor. If failure results in no flow, no safety consequence will be seen.  If N2 supply is disabled, all bellows valves will fail safe resulting in them closing and shutting off H2, C2H6 and CH4 and/or C3H8 mix.
Extreme reaction exotherm
The following calculation shows the explosive pressure when extreme reaction exotherm occurs. The hydrocracking reaction of butane is very exothermic and the most possible heat is generated when butanes are cracked into methane via the formula below.

	ΔrH0 = −43.47 kJ/mol
Brode's method (Brode, 1959) provides a simple relation between the burst pressure and explosion energy, which is expressed below:	
where Ε is the energy of explosion (energy);	
P1 is the initial pressure;	
P2 is the burst pressure of the vessel;	
V is the volume of expanding gas (V = Cπr2h, C - the proportion of void volume, r – inner radius of reactor, h – height of reaction zone);	
γ = Cp/Cv is the heat capacity ratio for the gas.
We can assume that the explosion energy comes from the exothermic hydrocracking reaction,  (R = 8.314 cm3 MPa mol-1 K-1, T = 400 °C = 673 K).
The burst pressure, P2, can be therefore written as	
.
In this calculation,	
P1 = 1.48 MPa (200 psig);	
V = Cπr2h, where C ≈ 0.5, r ≈ 1 cm = 0.4 in, h ≈ 15 cm = 6 in.;	
γ ≈ 1.3 (methane).
By plugging in all known values, P2 = 4.93 MPa = 715 psig, which is within the rating of the reactor tube.

The unit is to be leak-tested in two different ways, depending on the most recent operation. In the event that the unit is under normal operation and only the reactor unit is replaced when changing catalysts, only the reactor section must be pressure tested. However, the entire unit should be pressure-tested in case of a line-break. This example is for reactor#1 pressure testing only.
1. Ensure V111 and block valve BV-04 (C4) are closed (de-energized), open V021 & V023 to safety purge with N2 via V114;
2. Open V115 inlet of R1 and open V021 & V023  (house HP N2), and set MFC-011 to flowrate (300 sccm) to pressurize the reactor to 200 psig (or any other operating pressure of interest); Please make sure that reactor outlet valve V148 is closed.

A catalyst regeneration steps are followed and programmed in PLC for flammability shutdown to prevent formation of flammable mixture. A detailed description of the “Regeneration” steps can be found in Table 11.
1. Make sure the reactor is under ambient pressure
2. Make sure the hydrogen and hydrocarbon flows are turned off
3. Allow the 5-min N2 purge (300 sccm) to finish
4. Set MFC 61/62 R1/R2 (air) and MFC 11/12 R1/R2 (N2) to desired value 
5. Heat reactor to desired temperature (up to 550 °C) and allow to treat for desired time
6. Once treatment is completed, lower the reactor temperature as needed 
7. Allow the 5-min N2 purge (300 sccm) to finish after regeneration
8. Reduce the catalyst in H2 (100 sccm) at 400 °C for two hours before testing the catalyst performance
[bookmark: _Toc36196322]Emergency shutdown
In an emergency, the big red button on the front of the PLC or the fume hood can be pressed by anyone. Either action will turn off the PLC and trigger a complete shutdown of the entire unit: all power is cut to the heaters and pumps; solenoid valves are de-energized. This is a latching alarm that requires operator intervention to disable. Also lower the hood sashes so that all compounds in the hood are vented.
[bookmark: _Toc36196323]Activation of nickel guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
1. Switch three-way valve V114 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow H2/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069.
2. Begin flowing N2 to heat the nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8ºC min-1 to 180 ºC. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggest Gas Hourly Space Velocity of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1.
3. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours.
4. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service.
5. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
[bookmark: _Toc36196324]Activation of Cu-Zn guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
This procedure is designed to reduce a bed of Cu-Zn adsorbent in approximately two (2) days. Higher or lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) will result in shorter or longer reduction times. The recommended gas flow (H2 + N2) should be no less than 5 mLgas mLbed-1 min-1 to insure good gas distribution and reaction efficiency.
1. Preheat the bed with 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1, gradually bringing the inlet temperature up to 150°C during a 3-hour period. The N2 flow should be maintained at this rate throughout the reduction step.
2. Begin dosing H2 at 1 % by volume by adding 0.05 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1 to the N2. This should cause a moderate exotherm. Holding the H2 concentration at 1 vol. %, gradually bring the inlet temperature up to 180°C during a one hour period.
3. Hold the 1 vol. % H2 concentration and the 180°C inlet temperature for another 8 hours for the initial stage of reduction to be completed at the conditions selected. The "hot-spot" should have travelled all the way through the bed during this time. Else continue until the “hot-spot” has passed through the bed. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225 °C.
4. Increase the H2 concentration to 2 % by volume (0.1 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue feeding the 2 vol. % mixture for 4 - 6 hours, maintaining the inlet temperature at 180°C. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225°C.
5. Increase the H2 concentration to 4 % by volume (0.2 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue at 4 vol. % H2 for 4 hours. During this step, slowly increase the inlet temperature to 200°C without allowing the bed temperatures to exceed 225°C.
6. Finally, increase the H2 concentration to 6 % by volume (3 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), increase inlet temperature to 215 – 225°C and hold for one hour at this temperature to complete the reduction. The production of water at the outlet should have gradually decreased to near zero at this point. Additionally, the hydrogen levels at the outlet of the bed should be close to the inlet hydrogen levels.
7. Stop the H2 flow and cool slowly with at least 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1 at a cooling rate not in excess of 50 °C h-1, until the bed temperatures reaches service temperature (200–250 °C). The catalyst is now activated and must not be allowed to contact air. Maintain under inert gas until put in service.
8. Turn TW-68 to keep the pretreatment gases from entering the guard bed. Set TW 64, 67, 69 & 65 to route the LPG feed to the guard bed or bypassing the guard bed as needed.

[bookmark: _Toc36196325]Empty the guard bed
The active components of the guard bed is Nickel or Copper metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
1. Switch three-way valve V115 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow Air/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069 and make sure that c4 liquid feed is bypassed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 on liquid feed page 3.
2. Depressurize the guard bed to ambient pressure by tuning TW-69;
3. Turn TW-68 & TW-67 & Purge the guard bed with hot N2 (5 mLgas mLbed min-1) at 150 ºC for 30 min to remove all the hydrocarbons.
4. Slowly add 1% air to the flowing N2 and allow any exotherm to pass through the media by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h).
5. Increase the air to 2%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
6. Increase the air to 4%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
7. Increase the air to 10%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
8. At this point the media should be passivated enough to handle safely after it has been cooled to ambient temperature.
9. Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the used adsorbent to a waste container inside the hood and labeled properly for disposal.

The liquid-gas separators at the reactor downstream have to be emptied on a weekly basis or as needed. Operation must be done when the hood is working to allow sufficient exhaust:
1. Ensure the hood flow is sufficient;
2. Open BV-06,07 and slowly open NV-03, NV-L02;
3. Close NV-03,NV-L02 soon after liquid is visible in the Teflon tubing;
4. Close BV-07,06;
[bookmark: _Toc36196327]Operating limits
Table 5 & 6 gives an overview of the normal ranges for various operating variables. Outside these limits, if a variable reaches the threshold, the PLC will alarm audibly & shutdown, the PLC will start the automatic shutdown routine. 
1Shutdown action on high reactor temperature and flammable mixture: Cut power to trace-lines and furnace zones, block feed lines, MFCs off, N2 purge

2Shutdown action on high reactor pressure: Cut power to trace-lines and furnace zones, block feed lines, MFCs off, no N2 purge

3Shutdown action on high temperature alarm for heated line or valve box: Heater’s set point/output to zero.

Unit should be depressurized and purged and all components should be at room temperature before any routine maintenance is performed. De-energizing the unit also includes removing electrical forms of energy prior to working on these areas. Operators will be trained to have an understanding of how to remove stored forms of energy in the Unit.
All other maintenance is considered non-routine, and a work order will be placed to the facility team in the event of non-routine or emergency maintenance. This includes if aspects of the unit are hardwired. 
All scheduled preventative maintenance should be recorded in the unit logbook. All tests performed during annual shutdowns will be documented and sent to facility team lead (Andrew Kuzla).

[bookmark: _Toc36196285]Process overview
[bookmark: _Toc36196286]Introduction
Hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis processes convert various C4 feedstocks (e.g., n-butane/iso-butane, pentane, pentene, etc.) into light paraffin gases (primarily ethane and propane), which can then be used as a feedstock for light olefins. 
C4H10 + H2 → 2 C2H6
The objective of the proposed process is to investigate long-term deactivation, life-time study and regeneration of deactivated catalysts (zeolite and alike, or metal oxides). 
A reactor system consisting of two reactors has been retrofitted to test long-term performance of different solid catalysts and subsequent regeneration. The reactor feed for the process consists of high-pressure hydrogen (350 psi) and co-feed mixture of hydrogen, ethane (325 psig), methane and   propane (325 psig) from independent cylinders in bay 15 outside the building. A pressurized cylinder of liquid C4 located in the flammable cylinder cabinet feeds two Bronkhorst mini Cori flow liquid MFCs (flow range: 0.01 to 20 g/h (precision 0.5%)) inside the hood. The liquid C4 feed from the liquid MFC will be vaporized before being mixed with the hydrogen feed on a 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2 basis. Based on the literature, the reactor effluent or product stream may contain C1-C4 paraffins, small amounts of C2-C6 olefins, and small quantities of aromatics. 
Typical hydrocracking catalysts are composed of an acidic support and a metal, which work together to give the catalysts dual cracking and hydrogenation capabilities. Common supports include zeolites (e.g., modified ZSM-5), zeolite-type catalysts, and metal oxides. Metals active for hydrogenation include Pt, Pd, Ni-W, and Co-Mo, among others. The catalysts will generally be of the solid acid types, such as acidic zeolites (ZSM, USY, beta, mordenite) modified with noble or base metals. It is possible that catalysts consisting of noble or base metals supported on typical oxide supports (alumina, silica, titania, magnesia) will also be used. 
Typical hydrogenolysis catalysts are composed of supported monometallic or bimetallic catalysts. Common supports include metal oxides (e.g., SiO2, TiO¬2, Al2O3, etc.), zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, NaY, etc.,), and zeolite-type catalysts. Metals active for hydrogenolysis include Pt, Ir, Rh, and Ru, among others.
Typical test conditions for deactivation typically include temperatures between RT-600 °C and high pressures between ambient pressure-280 psig. Typical test conditions for regeneration of spent catalysts include temperature 300-500 °C with 0.5 % of air in nitrogen at ambient pressure.

[bookmark: _Ref487628544]The reactor feed will be 1:0.1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
Mixed feed line (SP-81) which contains hydrogen and hydrocarbon mixture has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. The typical mixed feed composition includes approximately ~ 74 % hydrogen, ~ 19 % methane, ~ 7 % ethane and trace amount of propane ~ 0.01 %. 
The high-pressure hydrogen line and the house high-pressure nitrogen line are regulated down to 350 psig before the mass flow controllers; the flow controllers for these lines (0-350 sccm for H2 and N2, 0-300 sccm for N2, 0-200 sccm for mixed feed) are calibrated for their respective gases. The hydrocarbon cylinder (butane, e.g.) is housed in the lab in a vented cylinder cabinet, fitted with a sprinkler head. The butane cylinder contains a dip-tube and helium blanket, and is fed via a dedicated cylinder, which is located in blue cabinet next to C4 cylinder. The feed gas pressures and others used for the GC are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 details the operating conditions for this reactor setup.

[bookmark: _Toc36196289]Catalyst
Zeolite or metal-oxide catalysts with a metal active for hydrogenation have been reported to be active for converting alkanes into LPG. A typical catalyst is platinum-loaded ZSM-5. Various modified ZSM-5 and alumina/silica are the two groups of catalyst that were studied for this reaction.  We will be testing potential literature catalysts and new catalysts from the two groups and similar types of catalysts.
The catalyst powder will be pressed and then sieved to 20-40 mesh before loading into the reactor. The catalyst loading will range between 0.1-10 g, typically 1 g catalyst. The team has to review the MSDS and health, safety and environmental hazards of chemicals used for catalyst preparation.
[bookmark: _Ref494878095][bookmark: _Toc36196290]Safety concerns 
A major safety concern is the flammability of H2 and the C4 feedstock. In addition, small quantities of aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) may be present in the product stream depending on the type of catalyst used.  
The flammability limits of hydrogen are 4-74% in air; it is also a simple asphyxiant.  Hydrogen cylinders are located outside the building on the cylinder pad in bay 15.  Six pack hydrogen cylinder with regulator is used to continuously feed the H2 feed.  
The flammability limits of butane are 1.86-8.41% in air. Other possible feeds (e.g., isobuane, isobutene, etc.) have similar flammability limits. C4 will be fed from a pressurized cylinder with a helium blanket placed in a flammable cylinder cabinet. Refer to Table 10 under Section 3.0 for detailed flammability limits for methane, ethane and propane in air. 
The spent catalysts in the reactor may be treated with air for regeneration. The formation of a flammable mixture between air and H2/hydrocarbon is prevented by updating the flammability safety calculation in PLC to air. Once % HC (butane) is inside the flammable region (LFL×90% < %HC < UFL×110%), the unit will be in alarm and shut down as discussed in Section 2.7 Safety Control System (Table 10). In addition, there are three-way valves (V115, V215 for R1 and R2, respectively) that prevent mixing hydrogen with air simultaneously. Reactors will be purged with N2 before and after regeneration. 
As mentioned earlier, the reactor product stream may contain a small amount of benzene, a known carcinogen.  Operator exposure to the product stream is potentially harmful.  Operator entry in the hood is prohibited when feed is flowing to either unit. The entire process will take place inside the hood and will be leak checked prior to each run. Handling of feed and liquid products will require proper PPE as described in a later section. 
Table 4 below shows the physical properties of the feed and possible products. See Section 3 Industrial hygiene for more information on physical properties of feed and expected effluent.
The operation of the reactor is unattended.  Simultaneous malfunction of the hood and a reactor fitting or valve leak could allow escape of hydrocarbons into the lab. To handle this scenario, the hood function will be monitored continuously such that if the air flow in the hood falls below 70% of the normal, the unit shuts down in latching mode. The unit will restart only when the operator acknowledges the hood shutdown and resets all sensor monitoring.

[bookmark: _Toc36196291] Environmental concerns
The process generates relatively large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and highest flowrate is proposed to ensure the emission of VOCs from this project to be within our current air permit. As of June 2017, our air permit (PBR) allows 25 tons per year (tpy) of VOCs at STC-H and we currently stand at about 14 tpy.
The typical product distribution, assuming C4 is the hydrocarbon used, is 10 wt. % methane, 40 wt. % ethane, 45 wt. % propane and 5 wt. % butanes, among which propane and butanes are the VOCs requiring regulation. In the event other hydrocarbons are utilized, operators will verify the potential product slate is within the range needed to comply with VOC regulations. Our highest flow rate (25 kg/day butanes) will generate approximately 5 tpy VOCs on an unrestricted potential to emit, which will increase our emission potential to 19 tpy, which is still below the 25 tpy limit.
[bookmark: _Toc36196292]Unit description
[bookmark: _Toc36196293]Reactor description
The reactor is a 1/2” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel with VCR fittings.  The ½” O.D. x .049” wall thickness stainless steel tubing has a pressure rating of 3700 psig at a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C.  The allowable working pressure rating at elevated temperatures for this tubing is 2923 psig at 426 °C and 2812 psig at 537°C.  It is anticipated this process will screen catalysts at RT – 600 °C. 
The reactor tube is fitted with connections to accept S.S. ½” fittings and reduced to 1/4” fittings and tubing outside the furnace.  The reactor is fitted internally with a 1/8” seven-point thermocouple probe.  There is an internal thermocouple within each of the two heating zones that has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.  The additional points are to monitor the catalyst bed and reactor temperature profile.  The thermocouple is 316 stainless steel.  Reactors will be visually inspected for evidence of corrosion or fatigue after every run and replaced as necessary or at least every 6 months.
Reactor temperature is controlled by a 15” two-zone Applied Test System (ATS) clam shell furnace.  The furnace has a maximum temperature rating of 1100 °C. The furnace consists of two zones, each 6 inches long.  No reactor fittings are located inside the furnace; the top reactor fitting is 4 inches above the heated zone and the bottom reactor fitting is 4 inches below the heated zone.  Each furnace zone is controlled by an independent thermocouple in the furnace wall.  The two zones are independent with their own latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C. In addition, as stated above, one internal thermocouple in the reactor lined up with each zone has a latching high temperature alarm set at 700 °C that shuts down the unit.
In addition, 1/4” and 3/8” O.D. (wall thickness 0.049") X 20” long seamless tube composed of 316 stainless steel can also be used as reactors by swapping the ½” reactor.  The pressure ratings of reactors with different O.D. over a temperature range of -28 °C to 37 °C are presented below in Table 5.

*Pressure in psig
Internal thermocouples are used for a ½” O.D. reactor alone as the smaller reactor diameters do not have enough room to accommodate the 1/8” thermo-well. 
Heat tapes associated with each unit are for pre-heating the feed, and keeping products heated to the GC sampling valve after the reactor. The heating tapes on each of the feed lines have a maximum rating 720 °C.  They will be operated at a maximum of 250 °C and will be controlled with a PID controller using a K thermocouple mounted on the tubing surface. The heat tapes have a unit shutdown latching alarm set at 300 °C.
Reactor pressure is anticipated to be at approximately 100 psig; however, a backpressure regulator (BPR-R101 and BPR-R201 respectively on reactors 1 and 2 with a pressure range of 0-500 psig) will allow catalyst testing at pressures up to 300 psig.  The readout for the reactor pressure is located upstream of the reactor and will be via a 0-300 (PT-111) and 0-300 psig (PT-211) range process strain gauges connected to a digital readout on reactor 1 and 2 respectively.  The strain gauge generates a 4-20 milliamp signal that is calibrated in the corresponding pressure range.  The digital readout connects to the alarm box which is set to alarm at 300 psig.  A 0-600 psig dial gauge is also present as additional pressure readout on each reactor feed line.  If pressure exceeds the alarm set point (300 psig), the unit will shut down (latching).  There is also a pressure safety valve (PRV-111 and PRV-211 on reactors 1 and 2 respectively) before the reactor, and on each feed line, set to relieve at 400 psig. High-pressure nitrogen will be used for leak testing at 300 psig.
Hereinafter, unit shutdown means that power is cut from all furnace heaters, heat tapes, and solenoid valve to zero the flow on all the MFCs. It also includes zeroing the flow on the liquid MFCs to stop hydrocarbon feed from flowing. The bellows valves on the H2 fail close meaning flow is cut off, and the Nitrogen bellows valves fail open (except for the case where unit shutdown is triggered by pressure alarm) allowing purge flow through the reactor.  Each unit has its own shutdown independent of the other reactor.

Products are expected to be in gas phase predominantly.  Possible effluent components are unreacted H2, and C1–C6 Paraffins, olefins, and aromatics.  The higher carbon compounds (> C6) are not expected, but are possible.  All will be taken into account for safety and analytical reasons. Any effluent condensate will be collected in knockout bomb and the remaining gas will be vented to the hood. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196295]Reactor sampling and analytical
After the reaction section, the flow of material is directed away from the reactor and towards the analysis section. Immediately after leaving the reactor the pressure and temperature of the stream is measured, after which the gas is passed through a heated back-pressure regulator before being directed into a Valco sampling valve. After leaving this valve the flow is directed to the GC or the knockout pot. The entire analytical system train after the reactor requires heat input to keep the products from having the opportunity to condense. Therefore, all lines are heat traced after the reactor to prevent such condensation.
The GC is equipped with one FID (hydrogen and air as flame and helium as a carrier gases) and one TCD (Argon as carrier gas).

Temperature control is done by the ABB 700F Freelance PLC, through a set of solid state relays on the system.  The system is designed to monitor High, Sensor Break, and Loop Break alarms and display alerts.  Transfer line alarms will shut down only the individual transfer line output.  Temperature alarms on either zone of a reactor furnace or the catalyst bed will stop output for both zones of that furnace, change all of the mass flow controller set points to zero, the helium purge valves will open and an alarm indicator will appear on the control system screen.  All of these alarms are latching.  
The universal transmitters, PR 4116, are configured as separate temperature alarm units.  They are independent of the ABB control system and receive the thermocouple inputs directly. They can also convert the thermocouple input to a voltage or current output, which we send to the ABB control system for monitoring and data logging.  The PR 4116s are equipped with relays which initiate shutdown actions via separate solid state relays. 
Thermocouple being inside or outside side of catalyst bed are not affecting temperature control and alarms system in fact thermocouple outside of bed will have quicker response or closer to furnace temperature. The temperature alarms and alarm actions are summarized in Table 6 & 7.

The potential hazards can be broken into three major categories: temperature, pressure, utilities, and flammability.  The unit will have various high temperature and pressure alarms, and each of these will initiate different shut-down actions. The alarm actions are summarized in Table 7.

[bookmark: _Toc36196297]Chemical compatibility
Wetted parts of the system are all compatible with expected and possible components of the feed and effluent streams.  All tubing and valves are made of 316 stainless steel. The tubing will be visually inspected every 6 months to see if any corrosion or metal fatigue is visible and replaced if necessary.  The reactors are passivated with silcotek’s silconert 1000 process.  This improves the chemical resistance of the reactor wall.  Swagelok valve wetted parts are fluorocarbon (FKM), polyether etherketone (PEEK), or polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). 
The back pressure regulator has PEEK seals and.  PEEK has a continuous working temperature limit of 250 °C.      
Temperature ratings for the 3-way valves are all above 232 °C and 500 psig for allowable working conditions. The transfer line after the reactor and between the GC valves will be heated to approximately 200°C.

The following safety information serves as only a guide. Consult current SDS’s for up-to-date and complete information on the following chemicals. This is also not a comprehensive list of chemicals to be used in the unit, and is only meant to serve as a typical example of what this unit is intended to run. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196300]Reactants
C4 (butane): Extremely flammable liquid and vapor that may be fatal if swallowed and enter the airways. May cause drowsiness or dizziness. Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects. Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.  High concentrations may cause asphyxiation. In low concentrations, may cause narcotic effects such as headache, nausea and loss of coordination. May have damaging effects on the respiratory system, central nervous system, and liver. May irritate mucous membranes and cause dry coughs. A face shield should be worn when breaking transfer connections. 
Nitrogen:  Nitrogen is a simple asphyxiant.  N2 will be used to purge reactor.  Low and high pressure house nitrogen will be used.
Hydrogen: Simple asphyxiant. Extremely flammable gas. Forms explosive mixtures with air and oxidizing agents. Steel-toed shoes and safety glasses should be worn when handling gas cylinders. High pressure hydrogen (300 psi) will be used as a reactant. 
Nickel metal: Guard bed material nickel metal is highly flammable in air. We received this material passivated by CO2. Avoid dust formation, inhalation of dust (may cause cancer by inhalation), contact with the skin (may cause an allergic skin reaction), eyes & clothing. Wear proper PPE & use engineering control devise (hood) to handle this materials. Nickel occupational exposure limits OSHA PEL 1 mg/m3; TWA value 1 mg/m3; ACIGH TLV TWA value 1.5mg/m3 Inhalable fraction.
Copper-Zinc oxides: The active components of the guard bed, copper and zinc, are in reduced, & oxidized forms after activation, respectively. The sulfur impurities sulfurize the metals to form copper and zinc sulfides. Contact with powders or dust may irritate the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Zinc oxide, Aluminium oxide & Graphite are not irritating to the skin. May cause slight irritation to the eyes. Wear proper PPE & handle this material inside the hood. Occupational exposure limit of Zinc oxide, 2 mg/m3 USA. ACGIH (TLV) TWA 5 mg/m3 USA. NIOSH. Copper oxide LD 50 Rat: > 2,500 mg/kg oral, Dermal LD 50 Rabbit: >2,000 mg/kg. Fish LC50-0.19-0.21 mg/l-96 h, EC 50-0.11-0.039 g/l-48 h.
[bookmark: _Toc36196301]Products
Ethane / Propane: Flammable gas. Gas may act as a simple asphyxiant and mild anesthetic.  Direct contact with liquid may cause skin burns.
Aromatics: Aromatics in total comprise ~5 wt. % of the products. Benzene has low acute toxicity. Chronic inhalation of benzene can cause bone marrow abnormalities, anemia, leukemia, and other blood-related disorders. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classify benzene as a human carcinogen [1–3]. Reported levels at which chronic benzene exposure causes health damage vary, but the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) set an exposure limit of 0.5 ppm for an eight-hour day and 2.5 ppm for a 15minute period [4]. The odor threshold of benzene varies among individuals, but the detection average is 60 ppm, well above the chronic exposure limit.
Naphthalene is reported to have similar toxicities. Acute exposure to high levels of naphthalene or tetralin by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact is associated with eye and respiratory inflammation. Chronic exposure to naphthalene is reported to cause cataracts and liver damage. In addition, the EPA and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies naphthalene as a possible carcinogen [2,5].
Toluene and the xylenes are less toxic and have lower odor thresholds than benzene. This combination affords sufficient warning of the presence of toluene and xylene before dangerous concentrations are reached [4].

[bookmark: _Toc516495701][bookmark: _Ref517256538]Regeneration mode
The unit has the capability to regenerate the catalyst with air. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the formation of flammable mixture by feeding hydrogen/hydrocarbon together with diluted air. Our valve position prevent us from mixing flammable mixture of H2 with Air gases. We can feed Nitrogen with either flammables or Air.
This unit already has a PLC programmed for flammability shutdown for mixture of pure oxygen and n-butane which is safer than mixing air with n-butane. For detailed flammability PLC shutdown logic, please refer to the HAZOP document for the oxidative cracking of butane project. As an additional reference, the graph with limits of flammability of butane in mixtures of air in nitrogen, and of air, is shown below.  
Regeneration steps are as follow - hydrocarbon and hydrogen flows are manually disabled by stopping flows in respective MFCs. Start 5-min N2 purge at 300 sccm at ambient pressure, which is achieved by making the reactor outlet bypassing backpressure regulator. This will prevent the formation of a flammable mixture. Only after N2 purge, stop ball valve V117 of Rx1 & switch three-way valve V115 for reactor 1 and V215 for reactor 2 manually to direct flow from hydrogen/HC/N2 to air/N2. 
Following actions in Table 11, which uses Reactor 1 as an example manually.

The reactor feed will be 1:1 to 1:20 C4:H2. The high-pressure hydrogen 6 pack cylinders are connected to SP 80 line has been welded from the cylinder pad (bay 15) all the way to the hood and pressure tested at 525 psig.  The cylinders are connected with an excess flow valve and PRV set@450psig. The hydrogen line (SP-80) has excess flow valve with 2.3 SLPM at 350 psig. EFV will cut off the flow in the event of a catastrophic leak. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196303]Personal protective equipment
Safety glasses, long pants and long sleeves are required at all times. Lab coat is required for lab work on reactors, chemicals or catalysts.
Loading liquid feed vessel
Steel-toe shoes must be worn when changing liquid or gas cylinders.
Handling catalyst 
Lab coat, nitrile rubber gloves, safety glasses and close-toe shoes are required. Measuring and loading catalyst extrudates (precious metals loaded on zeolite and alumina binder) will be performed in open area of Lab 113. Since the catalysts are in extrudates form, the chance of dust spilling is minimal. Catalysts will be unloaded in the hood into a waste can on floor, since catalyst extrudates may be pulverized during reaction and give a higher change to generate dust.
Handling Guard bed materials
The guard bed material is Nickel metal & it’s flammable in air and therefore nickel guard bed material was passivated in CO2 as received for safe handling. As a result, the nickel beds needs to be activated in N2 or diluted H2 before use. Upon completion of activation, the nickel adsorbent is considered as a flammable metal and should avoid air exposure. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. All the operation from loading to unloading needs to be performed in hood to avoid any health hazards.
The guard bed materials are copper-zinc oxide supported on alumina. Similar to zeolite-based catalysts, the guard bed material is non-toxic and non-flammable solid and hence requires similar safety measures to that for catalyst handling.
[bookmark: _Toc36196305]Heated surfaces
The reactor is not removed from the system until it is at or cooler than 50 °C.
[bookmark: _Toc36196306]Energized equipment
All equipment is de-energized before any maintenance is performed.  The unit uses 208 V and 110 V power and all electrical equipment is enclosed in grounded cases.  These cases are not opened until the power plugs are removed from the power sockets.
[bookmark: _Toc36196307]Gas/liquid cylinders under pressure
All pressurized cylinders, including LPG, hydrogen and inert gases, must be closed and capped before any movement.
[bookmark: _Toc36196308]Waste disposal
Solid and liquid waste (spent catalyst, spent inert, residue from catalyst sizing, aromatic by-products) will be accumulated in sealed containers labeled according to STC-H policies. The solid waste will be treated as hydrocarbon contaminated solids and will be disposed of by the outside vendor at the end of the program or when appropriate. The waste collected in the liquid-gas separation vessel will then be disposed of in accordance with STC-H policies and with a waste-stream number. All gloves and paper used in handling solid and liquid waste should be placed in waste containers and disposed of according to STC-H policies.
The spent nickel and copper-zinc guard-bed adsorbents need to be passivated with diluted O2 before being discharged in to the waste container for proper disposal. No hazardous reactions occurred if stored and handled as indicated.
[bookmark: _Toc36196309]Spill control
Spills of catalyst from the reactor or heavy hydrocarbons from the feed system or the liquid-gas separator after reactor can both occur. For clean-up of small spills, wear proper PPE (Nitri Solve 727, Ultraflex Nitrile 22R or equivalent gloves, eye protection, and lab coat).
In the case a spill larger than 100 ml, notify Emergency Response Team and do NOT attempt to clean up the spill on your own.
[bookmark: _Toc36196310]Toxicity profiles
The following table summarizes the exposure limits (short term and 8 hour time weighted average), the oral LD50’s, and the inhalation LC50’s (lowest level of toxic effect occurrence), and PPE recommended for the chemicals that may be encountered in this process. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but rather a typical list of values for the types of materials this unit will be exposed to. All LD50’s are from human data or mouse/rat testing.

[bookmark: _Toc36196311]Safety concerns in various scenarios
In this section, we address what if scenarios of several safety concerns. 
[bookmark: _Toc36196312]Hood malfunctions
The fume hood where the reactor system is housed has a sensor and in the event the hood malfunctions or functions below 70% capacity, the total reactor system will automatically be shut down.
[bookmark: _Ref493162467][bookmark: _Toc36196313]Leaks at reactor inlet/outlet fitting
In the event a leak occurs through the reactor fittings, the feed and/or products may escape in the hood via approximately 400 °C-heated zone. As during the normal operation the unconverted feed gas and products escape to atmosphere, the gases will continue to escape to hood/atmosphere until the problem is fixed.
As a precaution hood sash remains closed during operation and operator entry is prohibited when feed gases are flowing.
Worst-case-scenario leaks of H2 and hydrocarbons
The excess flow valve (EFV) shuts off if hydrogen flow goes up to 2.3 slpm (0.0805 scfm). The calculation below describes the effectiveness of hood flow to dilute the worst case scenario H2 leak, which shows the dilution required for an H2 leak to be below LFL of 4.0% in air. The calculation shows that the dimension of control volume in the worst-case-scenario hydrogen leak.

[bookmark: _Toc36196314]Temperature and flow control fail
Temperature falling, resulting in cooling, poses no safety risks.  If C6 and higher molecules are prevalent, a plug could occur in a cold line.  Pressure alarms and relief valves would render this safe.  A high temperature in the reactor would be caught by redundant temperature alarms; one internally and one in the oven wall.
Since hydrocarbon and air cannot mix in the reactor, flow control fail will not result in a flammable mix in the reactor. If failure results in no flow, no safety consequence will be seen.  If N2 supply is disabled, all bellows valves will fail safe resulting in them closing and shutting off H2, C2H6 and CH4 and/or C3H8 mix.
Extreme reaction exotherm
The following calculation shows the explosive pressure when extreme reaction exotherm occurs. The hydrocracking reaction of butane is very exothermic and the most possible heat is generated when butanes are cracked into methane via the formula below.

	ΔrH0 = −43.47 kJ/mol
Brode's method (Brode, 1959) provides a simple relation between the burst pressure and explosion energy, which is expressed below:	
where Ε is the energy of explosion (energy);	
P1 is the initial pressure;	
P2 is the burst pressure of the vessel;	
V is the volume of expanding gas (V = Cπr2h, C - the proportion of void volume, r – inner radius of reactor, h – height of reaction zone);	
γ = Cp/Cv is the heat capacity ratio for the gas.
We can assume that the explosion energy comes from the exothermic hydrocracking reaction,  (R = 8.314 cm3 MPa mol-1 K-1, T = 400 °C = 673 K).
The burst pressure, P2, can be therefore written as	
.
In this calculation,	
P1 = 1.48 MPa (200 psig);	
V = Cπr2h, where C ≈ 0.5, r ≈ 1 cm = 0.4 in, h ≈ 15 cm = 6 in.;	
γ ≈ 1.3 (methane).
By plugging in all known values, P2 = 4.93 MPa = 715 psig, which is within the rating of the reactor tube.

The unit is to be leak-tested in two different ways, depending on the most recent operation. In the event that the unit is under normal operation and only the reactor unit is replaced when changing catalysts, only the reactor section must be pressure tested. However, the entire unit should be pressure-tested in case of a line-break. This example is for reactor#1 pressure testing only.
1. Ensure V111 and block valve BV-04 (C4) are closed (de-energized), open V021 & V023 to safety purge with N2 via V114;
2. Open V114 inlet of R1 and open V021 & V023  (house HP N2), and set MFC-011 to flowrate (300 sccm) to pressurize the reactor to 200 psig (or any other operating pressure of interest); Please make sure that reactor outlet valve V148 is closed.
3. After pressurized set N2 MFC-011 to zero and close V114;
4. A pressure loss of less than 1 psig over 15 min on PT111 is acceptable. If not, check the female VCR fittings on the tubular reactor for leaks with snoop to locate the leak;
5. Open V148 and slowly release V149 to depressurize;
6. If leak is detected, re-assemble the reactor and repeat Steps 1-5 until no leak is detectable.

Empty liquid-gas separator (Knock-out pots)
The liquid-gas separators at the reactor downstream have to be emptied on a weekly basis. Operation must be done when the hood is working to allow sufficient exhaust:
1. Ensure the hood flow is sufficient;
2. Place a hazardous waste container below V152 and V153 at the opening of the drain tubing;
3. Slowly open V152 and V153 to allow gravitational drainage;
4. As soon as all liquid has been removed, close valve V152 & V153;
5. Close the hazardous waste container;
6. Ensure the waste container is properly labeled.

4. Set MFC 61/62 R1/R2 (air) and MFC 11/12 R1/R2 (N2) to desired value 
5. Heat reactor to desired temperature (up to 550 °C) and allow to treat for desired time
6. Once treatment is completed, lower the reactor temperature as needed 
7. Allow the 5-min N2 purge (300 sccm) to finish after regeneration
8. Reduce the catalyst in H2 (100 sccm) at 400 °C for two hours before testing the catalyst performance
[bookmark: _Toc36196322]Emergency shutdown
In an emergency, the big red button on the front of the PLC or the fume hood can be pressed by anyone. Either action will turn off the PLC and trigger a complete shutdown of the entire unit: all power is cut to the heaters and pumps; solenoid valves are de-energized. This is a latching alarm that requires operator intervention to disable. Also lower the hood sashes so that all compounds in the hood are vented.
[bookmark: _Toc36196323]Activation of nickel guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
1. Switch three-way valve V114 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow H2/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069.
2. Begin flowing N2 to heat the nickel adsorbent at no greater than 0.8ºC min-1 to 180 ºC. Flow rate should assure uniform, turbulent flow across the media with a suggest Gas Hourly Space Velocity of 5 mLgas mLbed min-1.
3. After the Prosorb media reaches 180 ºC, if using Nitrogen, start adding Hydrogen at 10 mol% for 0.5 hours, followed by 50% for 0.5 hours, followed by 100% Hydrogen for 1.0 hours.
4. Cool the media to desired process temperature (typically between room temperature and 180 ºC, can be up to 250 ºC), while purging with N2 for 30 min to allow H2-free environment prior to placing in service.
5. (Switch to service conditions) add necessary valve actions here to allow LPG flow into the guard bed and go through the reactor.
[bookmark: _Toc36196324]Activation of Cu-Zn guard bed
The three way valves V114, TW-68, TW-67 and TW-69 should be properly positioned to ensure that the guard bed is isolated from the liquid feed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 to bypass mode, and accesses to H2 and N2 from R1 feed for conditioning the guard-bed materials. The temperature control of the heating of the guard bed is by PLC.
This procedure is designed to reduce a bed of Cu-Zn adsorbent in approximately two (2) days. Higher or lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) will result in shorter or longer reduction times. The recommended gas flow (H2 + N2) should be no less than 5 mLgas mLbed-1 min-1 to insure good gas distribution and reaction efficiency.
1. Preheat the bed with 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1, gradually bringing the inlet temperature up to 150°C during a 3-hour period. The N2 flow should be maintained at this rate throughout the reduction step.
2. Begin dosing H2 at 1 % by volume by adding 0.05 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1 to the N2. This should cause a moderate exotherm. Holding the H2 concentration at 1 vol. %, gradually bring the inlet temperature up to 180°C during a one hour period.
3. Hold the 1 vol. % H2 concentration and the 180°C inlet temperature for another 8 hours for the initial stage of reduction to be completed at the conditions selected. The "hot-spot" should have travelled all the way through the bed during this time. Else continue until the “hot-spot” has passed through the bed. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225 °C.
4. Increase the H2 concentration to 2 % by volume (0.1 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue feeding the 2 vol. % mixture for 4 - 6 hours, maintaining the inlet temperature at 180°C. Cut back or stop the H2 if necessary to keep bed temperatures below 225°C.
5. Increase the H2 concentration to 4 % by volume (0.2 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), and continue at 4 vol. % H2 for 4 hours. During this step, slowly increase the inlet temperature to 200°C without allowing the bed temperatures to exceed 225°C.
6. Finally, increase the H2 concentration to 6 % by volume (3 mLH2 mLbed-1 min-1), increase inlet temperature to 215 – 225°C and hold for one hour at this temperature to complete the reduction. The production of water at the outlet should have gradually decreased to near zero at this point. Additionally, the hydrogen levels at the outlet of the bed should be close to the inlet hydrogen levels.
7. Stop the H2 flow and cool slowly with at least 5 mLN2 mLbed-1 min-1 at a cooling rate not in excess of 50 °C h-1, until the bed temperatures reaches service temperature (200–250 °C). The catalyst is now activated and must not be allowed to contact air. Maintain under inert gas until put in service.
8. Turn TW-68 to keep the pretreatment gases from entering the guard bed. Set TW 64, 67, 69 & 65 to route the LPG feed to the guard bed or bypassing the guard bed as needed.

[bookmark: _Toc36196325]Empty the guard bed
The active components of the guard bed is Nickel or Copper metal. After use (presumably for months), the partially activated nickel adsorbent needs to be passivated in diluted O2 before removal from the guard bed vessel to prevent vigorous oxidation. Therefore, after following the proper passivation procedure, Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the spent catalyst materials in to the waste container for proper disposal. 
1. Switch three-way valve V115 from Reactor 1 page towards three-way valve TW-068 on page 3 to allow Air/N2 gas flow into the guard bed and go directly to vent by using TW-069 and make sure that c4 liquid feed is bypassed by switching TW-064 & TW-065 on liquid feed page 3.
2. Depressurize the guard bed to ambient pressure by tuning TW-69;
3. Turn TW-68 & TW-67 & Purge the guard bed with hot N2 (5 mLgas mLbed min-1) at 150 ºC for 30 min to remove all the hydrocarbons.
4. Slowly add 1% air to the flowing N2 and allow any exotherm to pass through the media by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h).
5. Increase the air to 2%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
6. Increase the air to 4%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
7. Increase the air to 10%, and wait for any exotherm to pass through by monitoring the temperature reading (> 1 h)
8. At this point the media should be passivated enough to handle safely after it has been cooled to ambient temperature.
9. Disconnect the guard bed and discharge the used adsorbent to a waste container inside the hood and labeled properly for disposal.

The liquid-gas separators at the reactor downstream have to be emptied on a weekly basis or as needed. Operation must be done when the hood is working to allow sufficient exhaust:
1. Ensure the hood flow is sufficient;
2. Open BV-06,07 and slowly open NV-03, NV-L02;
3. Close NV-03,NV-L02 soon after liquid is visible in the Teflon tubing;
4. Close BV-07,06;
[bookmark: _Toc36196327]Operating limits
Table 5 & 6 gives an overview of the normal ranges for various operating variables. Outside these limits, if a variable reaches the threshold, the PLC will alarm audibly & shutdown, the PLC will start the automatic shutdown routine. 
1Shutdown action on high reactor temperature and flammable mixture: Cut power to trace-lines and furnace zones, block feed lines, MFCs off, N2 purge

2Shutdown action on high reactor pressure: Cut power to trace-lines and furnace zones, block feed lines, MFCs off, no N2 purge

3Shutdown action on high temperature alarm for heated line or valve box: Heater’s set point/output to zero.

Unit should be depressurized and purged and all components should be at room temperature before any routine maintenance is performed. De-energizing the unit also includes removing electrical forms of energy prior to working on these areas. Operators will be trained to have an understanding of how to remove stored forms of energy in the Unit.
All other maintenance is considered non-routine, and a work order will be placed to the facility team in the event of non-routine or emergency maintenance. This includes if aspects of the unit are hardwired. 
All scheduled preventative maintenance should be recorded in the unit logbook. All tests performed during annual shutdowns will be documented and sent to facility team lead (Andrew Kuzla).

10.10.07 

3. Aims of trial run: 
Confirm CWP extruder can satisfactorily extrude optimized A6060 powder with d50 of ~170 μm and a span of 2.1 (using coarser catalyst)

Determine if two powder recipes are required for A6060 blue and black

Produce HDPE materials to be evaluated as new grades
Improved Sagging performance
Improved Resistance to crack growth (RC) performance

Uncertainties: the following will NOT be answered: 
	Scale up of test extruder to large scale (CWP)  is not guaranteed
	Process conditions ( PE2.3 /  LD6) are not investigated
	Type testing of PE2.3 materials does not guarantee that the same level will be achieved in LD6) 
	Extruder output SPO is no goal

Introduction


The concept of tie molecules is often used to explain measured mechanical properties such as elongation, toughness and impact performance and resistance to slow crack growth in various materials. Tie molecules are formed when a molecular segment from a crystalline phase crosses the amorphous region and has sufficient length to become incorporated in another crystalline phase. High molar mass chains as well as polymer chains with side branches that cannot participate in crystal formation are most likely to form tie molecules. There is a subtle balance between chain length and chain irregularities. Therefore, the amount, type and placement of the comonomer in the polymer chain are important factors which will heavily determine the final mechanical properties outcome.

In an extended investigation of Van de Esschert(1) and Tacx (2) various LLDPEs were characterized. It appeared that the molar mass distribution of Z/N LLDPE was broad and the average composition as function of molar mass decreased with increasing molar mass. The molar mass distribution (MMD) of the mLLDPE was narrow and the average composition was constant as function of molar mass. As an important result they found that there was also material having higher molar masses and a high comonomer content for Z/N LLDPE. This was proven by crossfractionation: first pMMF with subsequent aTREF and the reversed way: first pTREF with subsequent SEC-IR. This was not expected since the average composition decreases with increasing molar mass. So it was concluded that the chemical composition distribution at higher molar masses is broad. At a certain high molar mass, there is a whole range of compositions. High molar mass is assumed to favor tie-molecules. Z/N has more high molar mass material. Despite the presence of this material, the impact for mLLDPE is better. In this case, the chemical composition distribution (CCD) in the high molar mass range seems to be even more important compared to the presence of the high molar mass material.

Soares (3) et al. (ref Journal of Polymer Science: Part B: Polymer Physics, Vol. 38, 1267–1275 (2000) have investigated commercially available HDPE materials made under different polymerization conditions and catalysts using SEC and fractionation techniques. The main outcome was that ESCR increased when the molecular weight and concentration of polymer chains that crystallize in trichlorobenzene between 75 and 85 °C increased. Polymer chains present in this crystallization range were assumed to act as tie molecules between crystal lamellae. Therefore, a balance between molar mass and CCD seems to be crucial. In the high temperature fraction (above 85°C), the amount of comonomer incorporated in the polymer chains is quite low, leading to a low amount of tie molecule formation. At lower temperature fraction (below 75°C), polymer chains are not crystalline enough to form very effective tie molecules and these chains are concentrated in the amorphous phase.

Havermans (5,6) reported that the presence of high comonomer containing high molar mass material could have a negative effect on the material properties such as lowering pressure resistance in internal pressure tests (IPT).

Bimodal HDPE is a reactor blend of low molar high density polyethylene (R1 product) and a high molar mass linear low density polyethylene (R2 product). The high molar mass comonomer containing part is responsible for the mechanical properties (due to the formation of tie molecules) whereas the low molar mass side helps with processing of the material. Currently, a Ziegler-Natta catalyst (MT8.5) is used to make bimodal HDPE in the LD6 plant, Gelsenkirchen.

In the past, the average composition as function of molar mass has been determined a few times (ref. resolve report SAREP-79, other reports as well). It appeared that also in these cases, a decreasing comonomer content is observed with increasing molar mass which is characteristic for Z/N materials. The question rises whether there is a very broad distribution of compositions at higher molar masses in bimodal HDPE. This might lead to molecules having too high comonomer and too low comonomer content as in case of LLDPE. 

In order to get a deeper understanding of the structure-property relationships and to see the CCD in the bimodal HDPE as a function of molar mass, the following investigation plan was drawn:

· Perform a-TREF on A6060 and pure R1 products. 
· From the a-TREF profiles, choose the temperature fractions in such a way so as to have 6-7 fractions from the A6060 product. The same temperature ranges would then be applied to fractionate the pure R1 product. 
· From each fraction as well as the bulk of the material, SEC-DV-IR would be performed to get comonomer built-in over the molecular weight and hence, the CCD of the material.

It should be realized that TREF separates according to crystallizability. In principle the separation is according to comonomer content. However, below 40-50 kg/mol, there is also a molar mass dependency. Characterization of the fractions using SEC-IR is assumed to show the individual contributions of R1 (no comonomer) and R2 (comonomer present).  


Results and Discussion


As a first step, a-TREF was performed on pure HDPE component (R1 product) and A6060 product. These measurements were performed twice to see the accuracy of the measurement. Overlays of the a-TREF elugrams are shown in Figure 1.

[bookmark: _Ref377463693]Figure 1: Overlay of aTREF elugrams of sample A6060 and R1


Reactor 1 material shows a high temperature peak and a tail towards lower temperatures due to the molar mass dependence of the separation of TREF (ref L. Wild Adv. Polym. Sci  98 (1990) 1-47). R2 material shows also a high temperature peak but somewhat shifted towards lower temperatures. This must be regarded as strange since the R1 material is also present in R2 material. This might be explained by co-crystallization. It is also observed that R2 material has a strong tail towards lower temperatures. This is most probably explained by the comonomer distribution in combination with the molar mass dependency of R1 material in R2 material. At low temperatures a small peak is observed representing the very low molar mass materials and/or high(er) molar mass high comonomer content.

Based on the cumulative mass profiles, temperature ranges for fractionating the A6060 sample were chosen. The same temperature ranges were also applied to the R1 product. The cumulative mass profiles and temperature ranges can be found in the appendix.


2.1	Molecular characterization of the R1 product fractions


After the confirmation that the fractionation had taken place as desired (see appendix), the fractions were subjected to SEC-DV measurements. This will provide information about the MMD and the Mark Houwink plots can be generated. Since the molar mass of the R1 fractions is relatively low, molar mass calculations as well as MMD were determined using conventional calibration. (put ref Theo Scholte c.s.)

In Figure 2, an overlay of MMDs from all R1 product fractions from conventional calibration is shown. The MMD of the R1 product (bulk) has been included as well. The calculated molar masses for each fraction are summarized in Table 3 in the appendix.


[image: ]R1 and Fr1-7

[bookmark: _Ref377568380]Figure 2: Overlay of the relative molar mass distribution from conventional calibration of the bulk and fractions 1-7 of R1 product.

As seen in Figure 2, the MMD of the pure R1 product is quite broad (from log M = 2.5 to about 7). It has been recently shown that the high molecular weight tail of the R1 product contains long chain branched type of material (ref LCB in R1 report). The MMD of the 7 collected fractions is also shown in the same figure. With increasing fraction number, the MMD of the TREF fractions shift to higher molar masses. This is expected from the pTREF experiment as longer linear chains have higher crystallization temperature and will end up in the higher fractions numbers.

The MMDs based on universal calibration and Mark Houwink plots of the collected fractions were performed additionally. These plots are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively and calculated molar masses are summarized in Table 4 (in the appendix). Since the molar mass of fractions 1-3 is very low, it was not possible to evaluate these fractions via universal calibration.

Similar to the conventional calibration, fractions 4-5 and 6-7 show a strong overlap of MMDs in Figure 3. The corresponding Mark Houwink plot shows that fractions 4-7  as well as the bulk R1 product show deviation from linear PE behavior above log M = 5. This is an indication of long chain branching in R1 product (put ref LCB in R1 product). The amount of LCB material is increasing in the following order: fraction 4+5 R1 product fraction 6+7.


2.2	Molecular characterization of A6060 fractions

An overlay of the MMDs of the A6060 bulk product and fractions is shown in Figure 5 and the corresponding Mark Houwink plots are shown in Figure 6. The calculated molar masses according to conventional and universal calibration are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6 respectively (in the appendix).


[image: ]
[bookmark: _Ref377641614]Figure 5: Overlay of the absolute molar mass distribution from universal calibration of the bulk and fractions 1-7 of A6060.


As seen in Figure 5, all fractions as well as the A6060 bulk material show a bimodal molar mass distribution. Fractions 1-3 have a very broad molar mass distribution consisting of two peaks, a low and a high molar mass peak. The low molar mass peak apexes coincide with the peak apex from the R1 product. Fractions 4-7 have a pronounced shoulder at the high molar mass side of the distribution, which is mainly the LLDPE part of the bimodal HDPE (reactor 2 material). The overlap between R1 and R2 product increases with increasing fraction number. Additionally, the local minimum in each fraction is roughly at the same molar mass as the end of the R1 material from that particular fraction.

As mentioned previously, all fractions show a bimodal distribution due to the principles of separation process in TREF (ref: J.B.P. Soares, A.E. Hamielec Polymer, Volume 36, 8 (1995) 1639). It is stated, that the elution temperature in TREF is a function of the comonomer content of an ethylen-1-olefin comonomer. This dependence can be expressed with the Flory-Huggins expression (ref: L. Wild Adv. Polym. Sci  98 (1990) 1-47). The elution temperature decreases linearly with increasing comonomer content. This is the case for the high molar mass copolymer synthesized in the second reactor for A6060. For the low molar mass unbranched material of the first reactor a molar mass effect takes effect. The influence of molar mass can not be ignored as for low molar mass material the end groups of the short polymer chain will cause a lower melting temperature

The Mark Houwink plot is shown in Figure 6. The Mark-Houwink plot of A6060 powder and fractions 1-5 are overlapping with the line of the linear reference, indicating the absence of detectable amounts long chain branching. However, analysis of fraction 4-7 from R1 material showed the presence of LCB and this should be present in A6060 although at lower amounts due to dilution with the R2 material. In case of fractions 6 and 7, deviation from the linear PE behavior is seen. Here, the R1 contribution in these fractions is significant and hence, the deviation is seen. Additionally, it is likely that this deviation could also be a result of LCB formation in the R2 material. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, this interpretation should be treated cautiously.

2.3	Determination of chemical composition by SEC-IR

The fractionated A6060 material was analysed using SEC-IR to obtain information about the CCD and its width. Overlays of SEC-IR data of the A6060 bulk material as well as the fractions are shown in Figure 7. In the appendix, overlays for fractions 1-4 and 4-7 are shown. 
[image: ]
[bookmark: _Ref377728801]Figure 7: Overlay of the molar mass distributions and chemical composition of A6060 powder and fractions 1-7.

From Figure 7, it appears that the lowest temperature fraction (fraction 1) contains low molar mass with no comonomer (R1 part) and high molar mass high comonomer containing polymer chains. This fraction also forms a substantial part of the total eluted material (about 20 mass%). Most likely most of the low molar mass highly branched material will not be able to participate in tie molecule formation and hence, its contribution to the mechanical properties is expected to be low. It is likely that these highly branched polymer chains will be in the amorphous phase. However, this reasoning should be evaluated using techniques such as solid state NMR whereby quantitative information about various phases can also be achieved. In order to check the effect of this fraction on the overall properties, it has been recommended to fractionate this particular fraction out of the bulk and perform small scale mechanical tests to see the differences. Details can be found in the recommendations section.

With increasing fraction number, the R1 material contribution remains significant. This is seen in the R1 peak in the low molar mass side. R2 product increases in molar mass and decreases in short chain branching (SCB/1000C) with increasing fraction number. From fraction 2 onwards, SCB/1000C range is approximately 15 to 6.

From Figure 7, an important conclusion is that the CCD of Ziegler-Natta catalysed bimodal HDPE is very broad. For a certain molar mass, the amount of SCB in the polymer chains can vary from >6 to about 25 SCB/1000C. Since there are a whole variety of polymer chains with varying amount of comonomer, it becomes important to evaluate how many of these branched chains participate in various phases and correspondingly their effect on the material properties. In the recommendations section, a set of follow up analyses and investigations has been noted.

From these analyses, it has become clear that the CCD of the Z/N catalyst is very broad. As mentioned in the introduction, to make a new polymer design, the comonomer must be placed in the correct polymer chains. If the CCD can be made narrow throughout the MMD, especially in the high molar mass part then a lot in the mechanical properties could be gained. An additional advantage would then be that very high molar masses will not be needed to gain in mechanical properties and the molar mass can be made skewed, lowering the amount of extractables. To this extent, it is important to investigate the CCD of a metallocene catalyzed bimodal HDPE. Metallocenes are known to have a much narrow CCD. What advantage this would bring over the Z/N catalyzed material for various applications where bimodal HDPE is used remains to be investigated.


Conclusions


The results mentioned in this report are in line with those observed in reference (Bart’s report) for Ziegler-Natta catalyzed LLDPEs.














Recommendations and future work

As a follow up of this investigation and to gain a deeper insight into the material properties, following recommendations are given. 

-remove the fraction (low twmp) and che SH
-Investigate the effect of residence time distribution on the width of the CCD. Here, similar fractionation work can be performed on A6060 synthesized on a bench scale reactor and compare the results to this investigation. Additionally, a “pure R2” type of material should be included in this investigation.
-Collect enough fractions to perform liquid and solid state NMR measurements and get information about blockiness of comonomer incorporation as well as the composition of various phases.
-Since the low elution temperature fraction (31-81°C) showed the highest amount of incorporated comonomer, it is worthwhile to gather more information on this fraction and evaluate its effect on the material properties. One way to do so would be to remove this fraction from the A6060 material and perform various mechanical tests on fraction 1 free material. A possible route is by making a cast film of the fraction 1 free material and performing the mechanical tests on this. Additionally, x-ray and DSC measurements on the pure fraction 1 material should be performed to elucidate the lamellar thickness distribution.
-The influence of using a different comonomer (such as 1-hexene) on the CCD needs to be checked. For the same MFR and density, the amount of 1-hexene incorporated would be lower than in the case of 1-butene. How the CCD is affected needs to be evaluated.
-Currently, in the KSA bimodal HDPE assets, Basell catalyst is used for polymerization (also a Ziegler-Natta catalyst). To understand the fine differences between the Basell catalyst and the MT catalyst, it is recommended to perform a detailed molecular characterization investigation on the PE100 type of resin from KSA as well as pure reactor products.
-In order to evaluate the differences in properties for bimodal HDPE when metallocene catalyst is used, it is recommended to solution blend a pure “R2” material made from a metallocene with a R1 material. Differences in properties will be highlighted when compared to a comparable Ziegler-Natta catalyzed product.
-In order to get an idea about the possible phase separation (if it exists), contact with the CULGI expert (Jan Groenewald) will be taken up.

Based on the cumulative mass profiles shown in Figure 8 (see below), temperature ranges for fractionating the A6060 sample were chosen. These temperature ranges (see Table 1) were chosen in such a way that each fraction has comparable amount of the eluted sample (approximately 10%). Therefore, some of the temperature ranges are very broad and some are very narrow. Only in the case of fraction 7 (highest temperature fraction), the amount of eluted sample is very low. After the temperature ranges were fixed for fractionating A6060 sample, the same temperature ranges were used for fractionating R1 product. The R1 data is summarized in Table 2.

1: aTREF confirmation run


There is a temperature difference of 4 °C between the a-TREF and p-TREF temperature ranges for the same fraction. This is due to the fact that different solvents are used for both techniques; a temperature correction is carried out to account for this.

In order to confirm and check that the p-TREF was carried out successfully, a-TREF on 3 fractions was performed for both A6060 and R1 products. Fractions chosen were fractions 1, 3 and 6 corresponding to the low, middle and high temperature ranges. An overlay of the a-TREF elugrams for R1 and A6060 samples are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively.

[image: ]

[bookmark: _Ref377562942]Figure 10: Re-analysis of the pTREF fractions indicated in Table 1 by aTREF of sample A6060.


As seen in Figure 9, fraction 1 of the R1 product shows a substantial soluble fraction at low elution temperature, followed by a bimodal type of distribution in the intermediate temperature fraction. The reason for the bimodal distribution is currently not understood. Fraction 3 and 6 show elution of material at higher temperatures and the distribution is also narrow as expected. Soluble fraction for these fractions is negligible.
In the case of the A6060 product (see Figure 10), fraction 1 also shows a soluble fraction and a broad distribution in the intermediate temperature fraction. As seen for the R1 product, Fractions 3 and 6 of the A6060 sample show narrow distribution and more crystalline material elutes at higher temperatures. This indicates that the fractionation of the R1 and A6060 sample has taken place as desired and that there is no contamination from other fractions. 

2.1	Molecular characterization of the R1 product

In the case of fraction 1, a small shoulder on the low molar mass side of the distribution is seen. It is likely that that this shoulder shows the bimodal type of distribution in the a-TREF profile shown in Figure 9. However, at this point, there is no real evidence to prove this and further investigation would be needed. Fractions 1-3 have narrow MMDs and show close to Gaussian type of distribution. Fractions 2 and 3 start showing a small amount of high molecular weight tail that reaches log M = 5.5.
There is a strong overlap of the MMDs between fractions 4-5 and 6-7. This is most likely related to the temperature ranges chosen on the basis of the A6060 bulk material instead of the R1 material. With increasing fraction number, the high molecular weight tail starts becoming quite prominent.

[bookmark: _Ref377728812]Figure 12: Overlay of the molar mass distributions and chemical composition of A6060 powder and fractions 4-7.

In case of the bulk A6060 material, the incorporation of 1-butene over the molar mass increases with increasing molar mass and reaches a level of about 15 SCB/1000C at the highest molar mass side. In general, it can be seen that with increasing fraction number, the level of SCB/1000C decreases from a level of approximately 25 to <6. This is an indication of a very broad CCD.
Fraction 1, which is also the low temperature fraction range (31-81°C), shows the highest level of SCB measured amongst all fractions. This fraction is very broad in MMD and has a substantial low molar mass part (without comonomer) as well as high molar mass highly branched part. Fraction 1 accounts for almost 20% of the eluted material (see Table 1). By increasing the elution temperature range (81-91°C), the overlap between low molar mass part (without comonomer) and the high molar mass part increases as compared to fraction 1. The level of SCB over the molar mass decreases significantly to a level of about 6-10 SCB/1000C compared to fraction 1. Fraction 3 shows even a lower amount of SCB over the molar mass. The average level of SCB/1000C reached here is about 7-8. Remaining fractions show a constant level of comonomer incorporation over molar mass. This level is >6 SCB/1000C. By combining the data of all these fractions and correcting the amount for each fraction, the overall SCB distribution of the A6060 bulk material should be obtained. 

With increasing elution temperature, the amount of incorporated comonomer decreases significantly. These observations suggest that only a part of the molecules will participate as efficient tie molecules, connecting different crystalline lamellae. This implies that only a fraction of the incorporated comonomer in bimodal HDPE really participates in the environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) and impact performance.

57 ABSTRACT 
Supported iridium-containing hydrocarbon conversion 
catalysts which are at least partially deactivated due to 
the deposition of carbonaceous residues thereon dur 
ing contact with hydrocarbons are regenerated by (1) 
contacting the catalyst with oxygen to burn at least a 
portion of the carbonaceous residues from the cata 
lyst, (2) contacting the carbonaceous residue-depleted 
catalyst with hydrogen at an elevated temperature to 
convert a substantial portion of the iridium present in 
the catalyst to its metallic form, (3) contacting the re 
duced catalyst with an elemental halogen-containing 
gas at a temperature of at least about 300°C., and (4) 
repeating steps (2) and (3), in sequence, at least one 
additional time to thereby redisperse the iridium cata 
lyst component to a highly active, high surface area 
State.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 

1. Field of the Invention 
The present invention relates to a method for regen 

O 

15 

erating supported iridium-containing hydrocarbon con 
version catalysts. More particularly, the present inven 
tion relates to a process for regenerating a supported 
iridium-containing hydrocarbon conversion catalyst 
that has been at least partially deactivated because of 
the presence of the iridium in the catalyst in a large 
crystallite, low surface area form. 

2. Description of the Prior Art 
The deactivation of noble metal-containing hydro 

carbon conversion catalysts due to the deposition on 
the catalyst of carbonaceous residues is a common 
refinery problem. Catalyst deactivation is particularly 
acute with respect to supported noble metal-containing 
catalysts, such as platinum on alumina, employed in the 
hydroforming of naphtha feed stocks. Platinum con 
taining reforming catalysts are reactivated or regener 
ated by burning the coke or carbonaceous residues 
from the catalyst followed by a redispersion operation 
whereby the platinum contained on the catalyst, which 
is agglomerated with loss of surface area during the 
burning operation, is redispersed by treatment with 
chlorine, HCl or other halogen providing reagents 
alone or in combination with oxygen at elevated tem 
peratures. The techniques useable for the reactivation 
of platinum-containing catalysts are not directly appli 
cable for the redispersion of iridium. Unlike platinum, 
iridium tends to agglomerate at significant rates to 
crystallites of low surface area when exposed to oxygen 
at temperatures in excess of about 350°C. Further, 
unlike platinum, large iridium and iridium oxide crys 
tallites are not readily redispersed to their high surface 
area state by a simple chlorine treatment immediately 
following the burning operation used to remove carbo 
naceous residues. 
Several patents exist, namely U.S. Pat. Nos. 

3,134,732 and 3,625,860, that have disclosures that 
bear a superficial resemblance to the procedure em 
ployed herein. The disclosures of the patents, which are 
primarily directed to techniques for the redispersion of 
platinum contained in a reforming catalyst, relate to 
procedures wherein the agglomerated noble metal cat 
alyst substituent is redispersed using a single cycle op 
eration involving a reduction of the catalyst metals 
followed by chlorine treatment in either a reducing 
atmosphere or in the presence or absence of oxygen. 
Such single cycle treatment operations are not as effec 
tive as the process of the present invention for redis 
persing agglomerated iridium and restoring catalyst 
activity to essentially fresh catalyst levels.

the regeneration or reactivation of supported iridium

containing hydrocarbon conversion catalysts that have 
been at least partially deactivated by the deposition of 
carbonaceous residues thereon. The first step of the 
regeneration sequence comprises contacting the cata 
lyst with a gaseous mixture containing oxygen at a 
temperature of less than about 600°C. for a time suffi 
cient to burn at least a portion of the carbonaceous 
residues from the catalyst. While the burning operation 
has the essential effect of removing the undesirable 
carbonaceous residues, the burning operation, unless 
certain precautions are taken, also converts the iridium 
present in the catalyst to large iridium oxide crystallites 
which revert to low surface area iridium crystallites on 
reduction. Further, when iridium is used in conjunction 
with other metals in a multimetallic catalyst system, the 
burning operation used to remove carbonaceous resi 
dues serves to destroy the highly dispersed polymetallic 
clusters comprising atoms of iridium and other metals. 
Accordingly, when the desired polymetallic cluster 
structure is destroyed by the formation of a separate 
agglomerated iridium oxide phase, the activity of the 
catalyst for promoting hydrocarbon conversions is sub 
sequently much lower. 
Restoration of high metal surface area and reforma 

tion of the desired highly dispersed polymetallic clus 
ters, in the case of a polymetallic system, is achieved, 
following the burning operation, by contacting the 
carbonaceous residuedepleted catalyst with a plurality 
of sequential reduction/halogenation cycles. Each 
cycle consists of (a) contacting the catalyst with a hy 
drogen containing gas at an elevated temperature for a 
time sufficient to convert at least a portion, preferably 
a substantial portion, of the iridium present in the cata 
lyst to its metallic form and (b) contacting the reduced 
catalyst with an elemental halogen-containing gas at a 
temperature of at least about 300°C. A sufficient num 
ber of reduction/chlorination cycles are employed to 
increase the surface area of the iridium metal present 
on the catalyst to at least 200 square meters per gram 
(m/gm.) of iridium as determined by the carbon mon 
oxide chemisorption method described by Yates and 
Sinfelt, J. Catalysis, 8,348 (1967). 

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING 
FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the effect of various treat 

ment operations described in Example 1 on iridium 
particle size. 
The supported iridium-containing catalyst compos 

ites that are regenerated by the process of the present 
invention comprise a porous carrier or support material 
in combination with an iridium component and, for 
certain uses, a halogen component. The support com 
ponent of the catalyst is preferably a porous, adsorptive 
material having a surface area, as determined by the 
Brunauer-Emmett–Teller (BET) method, of about 20 
to 800, preferably 100 - 300 square meters per gram. 
This support material should be substantially refractory 
at the temperature and pressure conditions utilized in 
any given hydrocarbon conversion process. Useful sup 
port materials include: (a) silicon-based materials such 
as silica or silica gel, silicon carbide, clays, natural or 
synthetic silicates such as kieselguhr, kaolin, china 
clay, Attapulgus clay, etc.; (b) aluminosilicate zeolite 
materials such as naturally occurring or synthetic erio 
nite, mordenite, faujasite, etc. that may or may not be 
previously converted to a hydrogen or ammonia form 
and reduced in soda content by virtue of an exchange 
reaction with various metal cations, including rare 



3,937,660 
3 

earth metal cations; (c) refractory inorganic oxides, 
including alumina, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, magne 
sia, thoria, chromia, silica-alumina, alumina-titania, 
silica-zirconia, alumina-chromia, etc. and (d) mixtures 
of one or more of the materials referred to above. 5 
Refractory inorganic oxide materials are preferred 

catalyst support materials. In general, superior results 
are obtained when alumina, in particular the gamma or 
eta forms, is employed. Alumina is the preferred cata 
lyst support material when the catalyst is employed in 10 
naphtha reforming operations. The support materials 
described above are known articles of commerce and 
can be prepared for use as catalyst constituents by 
many varied techniques. Typically, the support materi 
als are prepared in the form of spheres, granules, pow- 15 
ders, extrudates or pellets. The precise size or shape of 
the support material used is dependent upon many 
engineering factors not within the purview of the in 
stant invention. 
As noted above, the regeneration process of the in- 20 

stant invention is particularly adapted to the treatment 
of deactivated iridium-containing catalysts. Iridium 
may be the sole catalyst metal present on the support; 
however, iridium may also be used in combination with 
other Group VIII metals or metals from Groups IB, 25 
VIA or VIIA of the Periodic Table of the Elements. 
More specifically, the iridium may be used in conjunc 
tion with one or more additional catalyst metals se 
lected from copper, silver, gold, iron, cobalt, nickel, 
tungsten, molybdenum, chromium platinum, palla- 30 
dium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, manganese or 
rhenium. The catalysts may also contain germanium, 
tin or lead. Particularly effective naphtha reforming 
catalysts are combinations of iridium and platinum. 
Most preferably, the catalyst metals are present in the 35 
form of highly dispersed clusters of atoms of said met 
als. 
Certain minimum amounts of iridium, alone or in 

combination with additional catalyst metals, should be 
present on the catalyst. This is particularly true with 40 
respect to catalysts employed in a naphtha reforming 
operation where the catalyst should contain greater 
than about 0.1 wt.% iridium, based upon the dry 
weight of the total catalyst. For other types of opera 
tions, lesser quantities of iridium may be employed. 45 
Specifically, iridium may be present on the catalyst in 
amounts varying from about 0.01 to about 3.0 wt.%, 
preferably in amounts varying from about 0.1 to about 
1.0 wt.%, based upon the total weight of the dry cata 
lyst. Typically, any additional catalyst metals, such as 50 
platinum, are present in the catalyst in amounts varying 
from about 0.01 to 3.0 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 1.0 wt. 
%, based upon the dry weight of the catalyst. Iridium? 
platinum naphtha reforming catalysts having maximum 
effectiveness normally contain 0.15 to 1.0 wt.% each, 55 
preferably about 0.15 to 0.5 wt.% each, of iridium and 
platinum, based on total catalyst. 
Iridium-containing catalysts may be prepared em 

ploying simple impregnation techniques. Such a cata 
lyst may be prepared by impregnating a support mate- 60 
rial with a solution of a soluble iridium compound and 
soluble compounds of any additional metals to be in 
corporated in the catalyst. Generally, an aqueous solu 
tion of the metal compounds is used. In the case of 
multimetallic systems, the support material may be 65 
impregnated with the various metal-containing com 
pounds either sequentially or simultaneously. However, 
it is highly desirable that the metal compounds, in the 

4 
case of a polymetallic system, be impregnated on the 
catalyst support simultaneously to maximize the de 
sired interaction between the metal components and 
thereby promote the formation of a highly dispersed 
polymetallic cluster structure in the final reduced form 
of the catalyst. The carrier material is impregnated with 
solutions of appropriate concentration to provide the 
desired quantity of metal in the finished catalyst. In the 
case of iridium-containing catalysts, compounds suit 
able for the impregnation of iridium onto the carrier 
include, among others, chloroiridic acid, iridium tribro 
mide, iridium trichloride, and ammonium chloroiri 
date. Additional catalyst metals may be incorporated 
onto the support by employing compounds such as 
chloroplatinic acid, ammonium chloroplatinate, plati 
num amine salts, perrhenic acid, ruthenium trichloride, 
rhodium trichloride, rhodium nitrate, palladium chlo 
ride, palladium amine salts, osmium trichloride, chlo 
roosmic acid, auric chloride, chloroauric acid, silver 
nitrate, copper nitrate, copper chloride, ferric nitrate, 
cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, etc. The preferred cata 
lyst manufacturing technique involves contacting a 
previously prepared support, such as alumina, with an 
aqueous solution of an iridium compound, alone or in 
combination with a compound of at least one. addi 
tional catalyst metal. 
After impregnation of the carrier, the composite 

catalyst is dried at a temperature varying from about 
100 to 120°C. The catalyst may be dried in air at the 
above stated temperatures or may be dried by treating 
the catalyst in a flowing stream of inert gas or hydro 
gen. The drying step may be followed by an additional 
calcination step at temperatures of about 260°C. Care 
must be taken to avoid contacting the catalyst at ele 
vated temperatures with air or other gases of high oxy 
gen concentration. If the catalyst is contacted with 
oxygen at too high a temperature, at least a portion of 
the iridium present will be oxidized, with loss of surface 
area, to crystallites of iridium oxide. In the case of 
polymetallic systems, the desired polymetallic cluster 
structure will not be obtained on reduction. 
Additional materials may be added to the iridium 

containing catalyst composite to assist in the promotion 
of various types of hydrocarbon conversion reactions 
for which the catalyst might be employed. For example, 
the naphtha reforming activity of the catalyst is en 
hanced markedly by the addition of a halogen moiety, 
particularly a chlorine or fluorine moiety, to the cata 
lyst. The halogen should be present in the catalyst in 
amounts varying from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt.%, 
based on the total dry weight of the catalyst. The halo 
gen may be incorporated into the catalyst at any suit 
able stage in the catalyst manufacturing operation, i.e., 
before, during or after incorporation of the active 
metal component onto the support material. Halogen is 
often incorporated into the catalyst by impregnating 
the support with halogen-bearing metal compounds 
such as chloroiridic acid. Further amounts of halogen 
may be incorporated in the catalyst by contacting it 
with hydrogen fluoride, ammonium fluoride, hydrogen 
chloride, or ammonium chloride, either prior to or 
subsequent to the impregnation step. Other compo 
nents may also be added to the catalyst composite. For 
example, the catalyst may be sulfided before or during 
use. For certain applications other than naphtha re 
forming, alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds may 
be added to the catalyst.

The iridium-containing catalyst composites may be 
used to promote a wide variety of hydrocarbon conver 
sion reactions such as hydrocracking, isomerization, 
dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, alkylation, polymeri 
zation, cracking, and the like. The catalysts are particu 
larly useful in promoting the dehydrogenation, isomeri 
zation, dehydrocyclization and hydrocracking reac 
tions that occur in a naphtha hydroforming process. 

In a naphtha hydroforming process (reforming) a 
substantially sulfur-free naphtha stream that typically 
contains about 15 to 80 volume % paraffins, 15 to 80 
volume % naphthenes and about 2 to 20% aromatics 
and boiling at atmospheric pressure substantially be 
tween about 25° and 230°C., preferably between about 
65° and 190°C., is contacted with the iridiumcontaining 
catalyst composite in the presence of hydrogen. The 
reactions typically occur in a vapor phase at a tempera 
ture varying from about 340 to 540°C., preferably 
about 400-530°C. Reaction zone pressures may vary 
from about 1 to 50, preferably from about 5 to 30 
atmospheres. The naphtha feed stream is passed over 
the catalyst composite at space velocities varying from 
about 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of naphtha per hour per 
part by weight of catalyst (W/hr./W), perferably from 
about 1 to 10 W/hr./W. The hydrogen to hydrocarbon 
mole ratio within the reaction zone is maintained be 
tween about 0.5 and 20, preferably between about 1 
and 10. During the reforming process, the hydrogen 
used may be in admixture with light gaseous hydrocar 
bons. In a typical operation, the catalyst is maintained 
as a fixed bed within a series of adiabatically operated 
reactors. The product stream from each reactor (ex 
cept the last) in the reactor train is reheated prior to 
passage to the following reactor. As an alternate to the 
above-described process, the catalyst may be used in a 
moving bed in which the naphtha charge stock, hydro 
gen and catalyst are passed in parallel through the 
reactor or in a fluidized system wherein the naphtha 
feed stock is passed upwardly through a turbulent bed 
of finely divided catalyst particles. Finally, if desired, 
the catalyst may be simply slurried with the charge 
stock and the resulting mixture conveyed to the reac 
tion zone for further reaction. 
Regardless of the hydrocarbon conversion reaction 

in which iridium-containing catalyst composites are 
employed, the catalyst tends to deactivate after use due 
at least in part to the formation of coke or carbona 
ceous residues on the surface of the catalyst. The car 
bonaceous residues on the surface of the catalyst cover 
the active catalyst sites and thus decrease activity. Ac 
cordingly, it becomes necessary to remove the carbo 
naceous deposits from the catalyst in order to return 
the catalyst to an economically viable activity level. 
The first step in the regeneration sequence of the 

present invention consists of treating the catalyst with 
oxygen in controlled amounts to burn at least a portion 
of the carbonaceous deposits which accumulate on the 
catalyst during use. This burning operation is carried 
out at a temperature of at least 300°C., preferably be 
tween 300' to 600°C. and, most preferably, between 
340 to 490°C. In a most preferred operation, the coke 
residue is removed from the catalyst by contacting the 
same with oxygen contained in minor concentrations in 
an inert gas, normally flue gas, so as to maintain a flame 
front temperature of less than about 460°C., preferably 
less than about 430°C. Oxygen concentrations in the 
burning gas are maintained typically between 0.1 - 0.5 
mole % in order to maintain this relatively low flame

front temperature. Following completion of the low 
temperature burn, the catalyst may undergo a low tem 
perature after treatment operation at temperatures 
varying from about 340-460°C. with a burning gas 
containing oxygen in a concentration of from about 0.3 
- 21 mole %, preferably between 1 - 6 mole %. 
Following the burning operation, it is highly desirable 

that the carbonaceous residue depleted catalyst be 
contacted with an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, to 
remove from the reaction zone any carbon monoxide, 
carbon dioxide and oxygen remaining after the burning 
operation. Desirably, the purge operation is conducted 
attemperatures of less than about 400°C., preferably at 
less than about 350°C. The purging operation can be 
accomplished by a continuous purge sweep or by evac 
uating the reaction zone containing the catalyst and 
then pressurizing the chamber with nitrogen. Alterna 
tively, the zone may be pressurized with nitrogen and 
then depressurized. 
Following the purging operation, if used, the catalyst 

is subjected to a plurality of reduction/chlorination 
cycles in order to redisperse the iridium catalyst com 
ponents, that is to increase the iridium surface area of 
the catalyst to a level greater than about 200 m/gm. 
This surface area level corresponds to an iridium parti 
cle size (length of a side of an assumed cubic crystal 
lite) of less than about 1 1A. 
The reduction step is accomplished by contacting the 

carbonaceous residue depleted catalyst with a hydro 
gen-containing gas at a temperature between about 
200 - 550°C., preferably between about 350° to 
550°C. Preferably, the hydrogen-containing gas com 
prises hydrogen contained in nitrogen and is substan 
tially free of sulfur or other catalyst poisons such as 
phosphorous compounds. The contacting of the cata 
lyst with the hydrogen-containing gas is carried out for 
a time sufficient to convert at least a portion, prefera 
bly a substantial portion, of the iridium contained in the 
catalyst to its metallic or elemental form. The pressure 
within the contacting zone during the time of hydrogen 
treatment may vary from about 0.1 to 30, preferably 5 
to 20, atmospheres. If a purge step is used following the 
carbonaceous residue burning operation, the hydro 
gen-containing gas is introduced into the reaction zone 
while the catalyst is at the relatively low temperatures 
used in the purging operation. Thereafter, the catalyst 
temperature is raised to the level desired in the haloge 
nation step by contact with high temperature hydro 
gen-containing gas. 
Following the reduction operation, the catalyst which 

has a substantial portion of the iridium contained 
thereon in the metallic (elemental) form is contacted 
with an elemental halogen-containing gas, preferably a 
chlorine-containing gas at a temperature of at least 
about 300°C. Preferably, the contacting of the catalyst 
with the halogen-containing gas is conducted at a tem 
perature varying from about 300-600°C. Most prefer 
ably, the temperature of contacting with the haolgen 
containing gas is carried out at a temperature varying 
from 470-550°C. There is no necessity for cooling the 
catalyst between the reduction and halogenation steps. 
It is preferred that the plurality of reduction/halogena 
tion cycles needed to redisperse the iridium catalyst 
component be completed without reducing the temper 
ature of the catalyst below about 300°C. The reaction 
zone pressure during the halogenation operation is 
preferably maintained between about 0.1 to 30 atmo 
spheres, preferably between about 5 to 20 atmo 



3,937,660 
7 

spheres. Desirably the halogen employed in the treating 
operation is used in admixture with an inert gas, prefer 
ably nitrogen. Most preferably, the concentration of 
the halogen in the treating gas mixture is relatively low, 
that is, the halogen comprises from about 0.005 to 5% 
by volume of the gaseous mixture with about 0.02 to 
1.0% by volume being the most preferred concentra 
tion. The contacting of the catalyst with the halogen 
containing gas is generally continued for a time suffi 
cient to incorporate from 0.1 to 4.0 wt.%, preferably 
from 0.5 to 2.0 wt.%, additional halogen onto the 
catalyst, based upon the anhydrous weight of the cata 
lyst. Generally, from a corrosion standpoint, it is desir 
able not to continue the halogen treating operation 
substantially beyond the point where chlorine is de 
tected in the gases issuing from the zone containing the 
catalyst in concentrations approximating the halogen 
concentration of the inlet gases. It should be recog 
nized that while elemental halogen, preferably chlorine 
or fluorine and, most preferably, chlorine, is a neces 
sary constituent of the treating gas that other materials 
may be present in the treating gas mixture. For exam 
ple, the treating gas may contain water, hydrogen ha 
lides, oxygen, and the like. The required halogen may 
be injected into the reaction zone containing the cata 
lyst as such or may be generated in situ by the thermal 
or oxidative degradation of materials containing halo 
gen. For example, chlorine may be generated by the in 
situ oxidation of hydrogen chloride. similarly, chlorine 
can be generated by the thermal and/or oxidative deg 
radation of C - C4 chlorinated hydrocarbons such as 
carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, ethylene di 
chloride, t-butyl chloride, etc. 
As noted above, the halogen-containing treating gas 

may contain water and/or oxygen; however, the con 
centration of oxygen and/or water in the halogen-con 
taining treating gas should be carefully controlled. The 
molar ratio of oxygen to elemental halogen in the treat 
ing gas should be maintained below about 10:1. Prefer 
ably, equal molar quantities of oxygen and halogen or a 
molar excess of halogen (oxygen to halogen molar ratio 
of 1:1 or less) is used in the treating operation. The 
presence of water in the chlorine-containing treating 
gas is beneficial since its presence serves to reduce 
corrosion and aids in the distribution of the halogen 
through the catalyst bed being treated. However, the 
presence of excessive amounts of water in the treating 
gas serves to unnecessarily wet the catalyst and possibly 
strip halogen from the catalyst. Preferably, the water 
concentration of the treating gas is maintained at levels 
ranging from about 0.005 to 10.0%, preferably 0.02 to 
1.0% by volume of the total treating gas. 
After completion of the initial hydrogen reduction/- 

halogen treating steps following removal of carbona 
ceous residues, the catalyst is again subjected to addi 
tional reduction/halogen treating cycles. Generally 
from 1 to 6 additional cycles are used in order to com 
pletely convert the iridium present in the catalyst to a 
metallic surface area greater than about 200 m/gm. 
Because of the tendency of iridium to agglomerate into 
low surface area clusters, the use of multiple reduc 
tion/chlorine treating cycles following carbonaceous 
residue removal is normally necessary to secure sub 
stantially complete redispersion of the iridium con 
tained on the catalyst. 
The regeneration process of the present invention is 

generally carried out in situ, that is, the catalyst being 
treated is maintained within the reactor vessels in

which the hydrocarbon conversion reactions are car 
ried out. However, the catalyst may be regenerated in a 
separate reaction zone. Typically, the regeneration 
sequence is started by discontinuing contacting the 
catalyst with feed stock and the reaction vessels purged 
of feed stock using techniques well known to those 
skilled in the art. Thereafter, nitrogen is circulated 
through the reactors at elevated temperature and oxy 
gen slowly introduced into the circulating nitrogen 
stream in order to burn carbonaceous residues from the 
catalyst. As previously described, oxygen, carbon mon 
oxide and carbon dioxide are purged thereafter from 
the system and hydrogen is introduced into the circu 
lating nitrogen gas stream. After the iridium present on 
the catalyst has been substantially reduced to elemental 
iridium through contact with hydrogen, the introduc 
tion of hydrogen into the circulating nitrogen gas is 
discontinued and elemental chlorine introduced into 
the circulating stream. Initially the chlorine reacts with 
the minor amounts of hydrogen remaining in the circu 
lating stream to form hydrogen chloride. After the 
remaining hydrogen is consumed, the catalyst comes in 
contact with elemental chlorine. Oxygen and/or water 
may be introduced into the circulating chlorine-con 
taining gas. If desired, the hydrogen may be purged 
from the reaction zone by passing an inert gas through 
the reaction zone prior to the introduction of the ele 
mental halogen. Following the initial chlorine treat, the 
reduction/chlorination sequence is repeated at least 
one additional time, generally from two to three addi 
tional times, in order to completely redisperse the irid 
ium present in the catalyst. Desirably, the elemental 
halogen is purged from the reaction zone using an inert 
purge gas prior to the reintroduction of the hydrogen 
containing gas. 

It is preferred that the various steps of the regenera 
tion process following the initial reduction operation be 
completed and the catalyst returned to use without 
contacting the catalyst with a substantially halogen 
free, oxygencontaining gas at a temperature sufficient 
to agglomerate further the iridium on the catalyst, e.g., 
above 370-415°C. High temperature oxygen contact 
ing during the course of the regeneration procedure 
may diminish the effectiveness of the operation by 
further agglomerating the iridium on the catalyst. It is 
preferred that the steps of the regeneration procedure 
be carried out in sequence. However, the catalyst may 
be subjected to various other treating operations during 
or between the reduction/halogenation steps of the 
regeneration procedure. Such treating operations 
should not convert any substantial portion of the irid 
ium to a crystalline oxide form or otherwise convert 
any substantial portion of the iridium and/or support to 
a state that would preclude the successful regeneration 
of the catalyst following the procedures hereof. 
Another preferred embodiment of the present inven 

tion involves reversing the direction of flow of the halo 
gen-containing gas with each reduction/halogenation 
cycle. For example, in the first reduction/chlorination 
cycle, the halogen-containing treat gas may be intro 
duced into the top of each reactor containing the cata 
lyst and passed downwardly over the catalyst. In the 
second cycle the halogen-containing gas is introduced 
into each reactor at the bottom thereof and passed 
upwardly over the catalyst. In the third cycle, halogen 
reagent is again introduced into the top of each reactor. 
Utilizing this mode of operation, substantially complete 
redispersion of the iridium is accomplished with a 



3,937,660 
lesser number of cycles than where the flow direction 
of the treating gases is maintained constant with each 
cycle. 
Following the final contacting of the catalyst with 

chlorine-containing gas, the catalyst is treated with 
hydrogen and returned to use without further contact 
with a halogen-free, oxygen-containing gas at a temper 
ature in excess of about 370 to 415°C. Prior to use, the 
catalyst is contacted with a gaseous reagent, preferably 
hydrogen or nitrogen that contains a minor amount of 
hydrogen sulfide or other sulfur donor, at a tempera 
ture ranging from 350 to about 425°C. in order to 
sulfide the catalyst. The sulfiding operation is normally 
carried out for a time sufficient to add from 0.3 to 0.15 
wt.% sulfur on the catalyst, based upon the dry weight 
of the catalyst. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
EMBODIMENTS 

The following examples illustrate further the regener 
ation process of the present invention. 

EXAMPLE 1. 

Regeneration of Iridium on Alumina Catalysts 
A 1% by weight iridium on alumina catalyst was 

prepared by taking 99 gms. of eta alumina and mixing 
it with 10 milliliters of an aqueous solution of chloroi 
ridic acid, the latter containing 0.1 gm. of iridium per 
ml. of solution. The catalyst was then dried in air at 
1 10°C. for 16 hours. About 5 gms. of the dried catalyst 
were then charged to a Pyrex glass flow cell, the air 
removed from the cell, and pure hydrogen passed 
through it at 500 ml/minute. The sample was then 
heated from room temperature to 500°C. in the flowing 
hydrogen, and held at 500°C. for 1.25 hours. Full de 
tails of the apparatus and procedures used can be found 
in the published literature (D.J. C. Yates, W. F. Taylor 
and J. H. Sinfelt, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 86, 2996, 1964 and 
D. J. C. Yates and J. H. Sinfelt, J. Catalysis, 8, 348, 
1967). 
After the reduction described above, the hydrogen 

was removed from the catalyst by evacuation with high 
vacuum at 500°C. The sample was then cooled to room 
temperature under vacuum, and two carbon monoxide 
isotherms measured at 20°C., using the procedures 
given in the 1967 article mentioned above. The particle 
size of the iridium, calculated from the amount of CO: 
chemisorbed, was found to be 15A or 180 square me 
ters per gram of iridium (m/gm. Ir). This indicates that 
the iridium was not fully dispersed, as the equivalent 
particle size for atomically dispersed iridium is 11.2A 
(238 m/gm. Ir). 
The catalyst was then oxidized in situ in its Pyrex cell 

by adding pure oxygen at a pressure of 5 cm Hg, heat 
ing from room temperature to 500°C., then held at 
500°C., for 2 hours. The sample was then cooled to 
room temperature, reduced in hydrogen at 500°C. and 
carbon monoxide isotherms run in a fashion identical

with that used in the first treatment. The particle size of 60 
the iridium was now found to be 50A (53 m/gm. Ir); 
this is a large decrease in dispersion levels, and indi 
cates the sensitivity of this catalyst to oxygen at ele 
vated temperatures (Treatment 2, FIG. 1). 
The third treatment of this catalyst, also in situ in the 

Pyrex cell, consisted of heating the catalyst from room 
temperature to 500°C. in a flowing gas containing 1% 
Cl, 1% O, 98%. He and holding at 500°C. in the pres 

65 

10 
ence of the gas mixture for 3 hours. After reduction 
and CO isotherms as in the first treatment, the iridium 
had a particle size of 1 1A, equivalent to atomically 
dispersed metal (i.e., every metal atom is on the surface 
of the support and accessible for catalytic reactions). It 
is interesting that in addition to undoing the damage 
done by oxygen in treatment 2, this chlorine treatment 
gave a better dispersion of the iridium than was present 
in the fresh catalyst (Treatment 3, FIG. 1). 
The fourth and fifth treatments consisted of two oxi 

dations at 500°C., the first with 1% O, in He (Treat 
ment 4), followed by oxidation in air at 500°C. (Treat 
ment 5). The iridium after this treatment was now at a 
very low level of dispersion, the particle size being 87A 
(31 m/gm. Ir), an undesirable state of affairs. A second 
chlorine treatment under identical conditions to those 
used the first time now redispersed the iridium to 13A 
(198 m/gm. Ir) (Treatment 6, FIG. 1). 
The well dispersed catalyst was then passivated and 

discharged from the vacuum cell. Two grams were then 
charged into a metal high pressure reactor for heptane 
reforming studies. The catalyst then behaved in a man 
ner typical of that which is well known to be character 
istic of a highly dispersed iridium on alumina catalyst, 
i.e., there was a high overall conversion and a high 
initial methane make (see Table I for details). After 
discharge from the reactor, considerable carbon was 
seen on the exterior of the catalyst. 
The sample was then re-charged to the Pyrex glass 

cell, and the carbon burned off the catalyst in a two 
step treatment. The first involved slowly heating the 
catalyst to 500°C. in a flow of nitrogen containing 1% 
oxygen. After reaching 500°C., the oxygen concentra 
tion was increased to 20% by the use of dry air, and the 
sample held under these conditions for 1 hour. All 
visible carbon was removed by this treatment. After 
reduction, CO isotherms showed an iridium particle 
size of 77A (35 m/gm. Ir) (Treatment 7, FIG. 1). 
The catalyst was taken out of the vacuum cell again, 

and put in the high pressure metal reactor for a second 
time. The sample then showed (see Table I) low con 
version of heptane and a low methane make--both 
being characteristics of an inactive catalyst having 
poorly dispersed metal. Little carbon was seen on dis 
charging the catalyst, consistent with its low activity. 
To demonstrate the ability of the redispersion tech 

nique of this instant invention to achieve multiple re 
generations, the sample was again charged to the vac 
uum system and the whole cycle repeated. That is, the 
carbon was burned off, sample reduced, then chlorine 
treated in the identical fashion to that used before. On 
placing the catalyst in the reactor for the third time, it 
was again found to be catalytically identical to a fresh 
iridium catalyst containing very well dispersed iridium 
(see Table I).

The catalytic data above were obtained 165 minutes 
after the feed was brought in contact with the catalyst. 
All values are given in mole % of feed. The reaction 
conditions were 454°C.; hydrogen:hydrocarbon ratio 
5:1; liquid hourly space rate 20 w/hr/w; and 200 p.s.i.g. 
total pressure. 

EXAMPLE 2 

Regeneration of Iridium on Alumina with Chlorine in 
Air vs. Chlorine and Low Amounts of Oxygen 

Another sample was taken of the catalyst used in 
Example 1, and reduced as in that example. The cata 
lyst was then oxidized in situ in its glass adsorption cell 
with flowing air at 500°C. for 2 hours. After re-reduc 
tion in hydrogen, and running the carbon monoxide 
isotherms, it was found that the iridium had grown to 
39A (69 m/gm. Ir) (Treatment 1, FIG. 2). 
After a chlorine treatment consisting of heating the 

catalyst from room temperature to 500°C. in the pres 
ence of a gas mixture composed of 1% Cl, 1% O, 98% 
He and then contacting the catalyst with the gas mix 
ture at 500'C. for 2 hours, it was found that the iridium 
had been completely redispersed (Treatment 2). 
The catalyst was again oxidized as in Treatment 1, 

and it was found that the iridium particles had grown to 
55A (49 m"/gm. Ir). The sample was then chlorine 
treated, after hydrogen reduction, as in Treatment 2 
except that the gas mixture was 1% chlorine in air, and 
the time of treatment at 500°C. (holding period) was 
for 3 hours (Treatment 4). Some redispersion of the 
iridium was achieved, as the particle size was reduced 
from 55A to 28A (96 m/gm. Ir), but this is substan 
tially less than the atomic dispersion level which is 
necessary for maximum catalytic activity. 

Finally, the sample was again treated with chlorine, 
after hydrogen reduction, as in Treatment 2 above, the 
original mixture now being used (1% Cl, 1% O, 98% 
He), at 500°C. for 3 hours. Again, atomic dispersion 
was readily achieved with the use of low oxygen con 
centrations, as taught by this instant invension (Treat 
ment 5). 

EXAMPLE 3 

Regeneration of Iridium:Platinum on Alumina 
Catalysts 

In this and the following experiments, a 0.3% iridium, 
0.3% platinum, by weight, on alumina catalyst was 
utilized. A typical preparative procedure includes con 
tacting 100 gms. of gamma alumina (in the form of 
1/16 inch extrudates) with a solution containing both 
iridium and platinum salts. The latter is prepared by 
taking 150 ml. of distilled water and adding to it 3 ml. 
of a chloroiridic acid solution containing 0.1 gm. of 
iridium per ml. of solution and 3 ml. of a chloroplatinic 
acid solution containing 0.1 gm. of platinum per ml. of 
solution. The alumina is added to the above solution 
and left for several hours at room temperature. After 
removing the excess water, the catalyst is dried in air at 
1 10°C. for 16 hours, then at 250°C. for 3 hours. This is 
catalyst 3(A). 
Five grams of this catalyst were charged to the appa 

ratus as used in Example 1, and reduced in hydrogen 
for 1 hour at 500°C. After CO chemisorption isotherms 
had been run, it was found that both metals were fully 
dispersed, as every metal atom was in the surface 
(equivalent particle size is 11.6A, for a 50%, 50% mix 
ture of Ir -- Pt).

A second catalyst 3(B) was prepared as follows. Fifty 

grams of catalyst 3(A) were charged to a furnace and 
heated in air at 760°C. for 48 hours. This experiment 
simulates temperatures which might be obtained if the 
temperature became out of control during the process 
of removing the carbon from catalysts deactivated by 
use under reforming conditions. 
Five grams of 3(B) were then charged to the adsorp 

tion apparatus, and reduced as detailed above for cata 
lyst 3(A). Very much less carbon monoxide was found 
to be adsorbed, and the average metal particle size was 
found to be 300A (9 m/gm. Ir). 

In the case of bi- or multi-metallic catalysts of this 
type, chemisorption measurements using gases which 
are adsorbed on all the metals used, can only give an 
average metal particle size. To obtain information 
about the particle size of individual metals, the only 
method available is to use X-ray diffraction techniques 
(see Yates et al, supra). 
When catalysts containing very small amounts of 

metal are used, for example, catalysts 3(A) and 3(B), 
different techniques than normal have to be employed, 
especially if the support material has an X-ray spec 
trum. This is the case with the alumina used here. The 
X-ray technique developed for this work is to first run 
the spectrum of the catalyst, for example, catalyst 
3(B), after reduction with hydrogen. Then a portion of 
the same alumina used to prepare catalyst 3(A) was 
taken, and heated in air for 48 hours at 760C., in a 
fashion identical to that used in preparing sample 3(B). 
The X-ray spectra of this calcined alumina was then 
run, using identical scanning procedures as those used 
with the reduced catalyst 3(B). These comprised re 
cording in steps of 0.05 in 20 over the values of 51 to 
12 of 26, counting at 80 sec. at each position to ensure 
good signal to noise ratios. The data were collected in 
digital form, and the two spectra were subtracted using 
a computer. Scaling was carried out, if needed, in re 
gions of the spectra remote from the metal peaks. This 
final subtraction gives the spectra of the metals alone, 
the peaks due to the alumina having been cancelled out 
by this procedure. 
Data obtained in this way with copper Ka radiation 

on a reduced sample of catalyst 3(B) show separate, 
discrete peaks for platinum at 39.8 26, and for iridium 
at 40.6 26, corresponding to the 111 planes. The parti 
cle size of the Pt was 620A and of the Ir 340A. The 
agreement with the chemisorption value (average 
300A) is reasonable considering the errors in both 
methods with these very large particles. The errors in 
chemisorption methods are least when the metal is fully 
dispersed, and become higher as the particle size in 
creases. With X-rays, particles of less than 50A give 
peaks too broad to be measurable, and as soon as the 
peaks are measurable, the optimum accuracy is ob 
tained. Above about 300A, the peaks gradually be 
come so narrow as to be indistinguishable from lines of 
the bulk metals, and this again decreases the accuracy. 
The process of redispersion, when part of the metal is 

in the atomic state, and some, say, in the 300A state 
can thus only be followed with X-ray techniques by 
measuring the amount of large particle size material 
remaining, as the metal with particle size below about 
50A cannot be detected in the X-ray spectrum.

EXAMPLE 4 

Regeneration of iridium:Platinum Catalyst 
A 5 gm. aliquot of catalyst 3(B) was charged to the 

Pyrex cell, and reduced in hydrogen at 500°C. It was 
then treated by heating from room temperature to 
500°C. in the presence of a flowing gas of composition 
1% C, 1% O, 98% N, and held at 500°C. in the pres 
ence of the flowing gas for 6 hours. Examination by 
differential X-ray spectroscopy, by the method given in 
Example 3, showed 5% of the platinum in crystals 
larger than 50A, and 45% of the iridium in large crys 
tals. The data from chemisorption can be put into a 
form to give the percentage of large iridium by assum 
ing that all of the platinum is well dispersed. This is a 
good assumption here. The chemisorption data then 
show 27% of the iridium to be in the form of large 
crystals. 

EXAMPLE 5 

Effects of Pre-Reduction on Regeneration of 
Iridium:Platinum Catalysts 

To show that the pre-reduction step is critical in the 
resispersion of iridium, which is an unexpected discov 
ery to one familiar with the previous art in this field, the 
following experiment was performed. The procedure of 
Example 4 was followed, except that the pre-reduction 
step was omitted. 
X-ray data (obtained as in Example 3) showed that 

0% of big platinum was present and 100% of the irid 
ium was present as large crystals. Chemisorption data 
support this, as the amount of gas adsorbed corre 
sponded to about half of the metal in the sample being 
of large particle size. It should be noted that this experi 
ment redispersed the platinum with good efficiency, 
showing that the pre-reduction step is not critical with 
this metal, and in addition showing the relative ease 
and non-criticality of processes designed to redisperse 
only platinum. 

EXAMPLE 6 

Effects of Multiple Treatments on the Regneration of 
Iridium:Platinum Catalysts 

As a further illustration of the beneficial effects of 
pre-reduction, dramatically demonstrated in the previ 
ous example, the following experiment was performed. 
The procedure given in Example 4 was followed, ex 
cept that the treatment with 1% Cl, 1%. O, 98% N, 
was at 500°C. for a holding period of 3 hours. Chemi 
sorption data were obtained after this step, and indi 
cated an overall dispersion of both metals to be 64%. If 
all of the platinum is resispersed, which commonly

Comparison with Example 4, where one pre-reduc 

tion was followed by a single 6-hour chlorine treat 
ment, will show the superiority of the method of this 
example. In this case, a six hour chlorine treatment was 
also given, but it was stopped after the first three hours, 
the sample reduced again, cooled to room temperature 
and a second three hour treatment given. In Example 4, 
after one 6 hour treatment, between 27 and 45% of the 
iridium was still in the form of large crystals, as deter 
mined by two experimental methods. In marked con 
trast, the present example, using two 3 hour treatments, 
(each preceded by a reduction step) resulted in very 
little large iridium being detected by either method.

takes place with sample 3(B) whatever the nature of 55 
the chlorine treatment, this corresponds to 72% of the 
iridium still being left as large crystals. However, this 
assumption was not verified by X-ray studies after this 
3 hour treatment, as it was desired to carry out a sec 
ond treatment without exposing the catalyst to air. 
The sample was then given a second chlorine treat 

ment, after hydrogen reduction, identical with the first, 
i.e., 3 hour holding period at 500°C. After this, the 
chemisorption data showed that, within limits of error, 
all of the platinum and iridium was in atomic disper 
sion, i.e., the effective particle size was 11.6A. X-ray 
spectra, obtained as in Example 3, showed no large 
platinum crystals and 12% large iridium crystals.

EXAMPLE 7 

Effect of Multiple Reduction-Chlorination Cycles on 
the Regeneration of Iridium:Platinum on Alumina 

Catalyst 
Another example of multiple reduction-halogenation 

treatments was conducted on a larger scale using 100 
gram samples of catalyst. The experiments were con 
ducted in a 1 inch diameter silica glass tubular reactor, 
36 inches long, at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst 
used in the test was taken from batch designated as 
catalyst 3(A) in Example 3 and was pretreated by heat 
ing in air at about 540°C. for 16 hours. This catalyst is 
hereinafter designated as catalyst 7(A). After this 
treatment, none of the platinum on the catalyst was in 
a particle size range detectable by X-ray diffraction 
(see description given in Example 3). All of the iridium 
on the catalyst was present in large particles (greater 
than 50A). 

In the first experiment, 75 grams of catalyst 7(A) 
were maintained as a single bed within the reactor and 
treated using the following sequence of steps: 

1. The catalyst was heated from room temperature to 
about 500°C. in hydrogen and maintained in the hydro 
gen atmosphere at 500°C. overnight. 

2. Hydrogen flow was halted and hydrogen purged 
from the reaction zone by passing helium therethrough 
at 500'C. 

3. A treating gas comprising 1 volume % chlorine, 1 
volume % oxygen in nitrogen was passed over the cata 
lyst at 500°C. The treatment was continued for 1 hour 
past the point when chlorine was first detected in the 
exit of the catalyst bed. 

4. The chlorine-containing treat gas was purged from 
the system by passing helium through the reactor at 
500°C. 

5. Hydrogen contained in helium was then passed 
through the reaction zone for a period until hydrogen 
was detected in the exit gases. This reduction was con 
ducted at 500'C. 

6. Hydrogen flow was halted and hydrogen was 
purged from the reaction zone by flowing helium there 
through at 500°C. 

7. Same as step (3). 
8. Same as step (4). 
9. Same as step (5). 
10. Same as step (6). 
1. Same as step (3). 

12. The chlorine-containing treat gas was purged 
from the system by passing helium through the reactor 
at 500°C. After the purge period was completed, the 
catalyst was cooled to room temperature in helium. 
X-ray diffraction analysis of a 1-gram sample of the 

treated catalyst revealed that the catalyst contained 



3,937,660 
15 

19% of the iridium in crystallites of greater than about 
50A. Originally the catalyst contained 100% of the 
iridium as large crystals. In other words, 81% of the 
iridium was redispersed into small particles following 
the procedure of the present invention. 
A second comparative experiment was conducted in 

which 75 grams of catalyst 7(A) were charged to the 
same reactor employed in the first experiment and 
treated with chlorine in the following sequence of 
steps. The catalyst was maintained within the reactor in 
two discrete beds of 37.5 grams each. 

I. Same as step (1) of the first experiment. 
II. Same as step (2) of the first experiment. 
III. Same as step (3) of the first experiment. 
IV. The catalyst was purged as in step (4) of the first 

experiment; however, the duration of the purge was 
equal to the elapsed time of steps (4), (5) and (6% of 
the first experiment. In other words, the purge of this 
step IV was carried out as long as the two purges and 
reduction step of the first experiment, steps (4), (5) 
and (6). 
V. Same as step (7) of the first experiment. 
VI. Same as step IV (corresponds to steps (8), (9), 

and (10) of the first experiment). 
VII. Same as step (11) of the first experiment. 
VIII. Similar to step (12) of the first experiment 

wherein the catalyst was purged and cooled to room 
temperature in helium. 
X-ray diffraction analysis of a sample of the inlet bed 

showed that 42% of the iridium was present as large 
(greater than 50A) particles. An analysis of the catalyst 
contained in the exit bed revealed that 70% of the 
iridium was present as large particles. The average 
large particle iridium present in both beds is 56%. Ex 
pressed another way, the average overall redispersion 
of the iridium present in the catalyst was about 44%. 
Comparing this result with the results of the first exper 
iment reveals that using reduction steps intermediate to 
the chlorine treatment steps results in a process that is 
nearly twice as efficient for iridium redispersion as an 
operation conducted without the intermediate reduc 
tion steps. 
What is claimed is: 
1. In a process for the catalytic reforming of hydro 

carbons wherein a hydrocarbon feed stock is contacted 
with a catalyst comprising from about 0.01 to about 3.0 
wt.% of an iridium component and a halogen compo 
nent contained in an inorganic refractory oxide support 
at reforming conditions, the catalyst having been at 
least partially deactivated during contact with said feed 
stock by the depositing of carbonaceous residues, a 
method for regenerating said catalyst after discontin 
uing contact of said catalyst with said feed stock com 
prising: 

1. contacting said catalyst in a reaction zone with a 
gaseous mixture containing oxygen at an elevated 
temperature of less than about 600°C. for a time

METHOD OF PRODUCTION OF ETHANE BY 
SELECTIVE HYDROGENOLYSIS OF ALKANE 

This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 699,972 
?led June 25, 1976, now abandoned. 

This invention relates to a method of production of 
ethane by selective hydrogenolysis of alkanes. 
The reactions employed in the hydrogenation cleav 

age of carbon-carbon bonds are hydrocracking and 
hydrogenolysis. These reactions are very similar to 
each other but a distinction can nevertheless be drawn 
by considering with J.H. Sinfelt in “Advances in Catal 
ysis” (Acad. Press. No. 23 p. 91 - 1973) that hydrocrack 
ing makes use of bifunctional catalysis, the catalyst 
being constituted by a cracking acid support and hydro 
genating metallic sites deposited on this latter. On the 
other hand, hydrogenolysis makes use of monofunc 
tional catalysis with reduced metals in which the sup 
port does not directly take part in the reaction. 
From a kinetic standpoint, the reactions of the ?rst 

type are of a positive order with respect to the hydro 
gen reagent whereas those of the second type are often 
of a negative order. 

It can also be noted that, when catalytic acid sites are 
employed with a view to promoting cleavage of the 
carbon-carbon bonds of the hydrocarbons of the feed 
stock (which is the case with hydrocracking), hydrocar 
bons are pfreferentially formed at C4 and C3. This is 
usually what is found when examining the gas produc 
tion of industrial units for catalytic cracking or hydro 
cracking of heavy gas-oils. Should it be desired on the 
contrary to promote the formation of compounds such 
as ethane, hydrogenolysis is undoubtedly the most fa 
vorable route. 

Scienti?c publications relating to hydrogenolysis of 
paraffms are relatively numerous. Good articles which 
make a synthesis on this subject have been presented 
among others by J .H. Sinfelt (as mentioned earlier) or 
by JR. Anderson in “Advances in Catalysis” (Acad. 
Press. No. 23 - 1973). The selectivities in general which 
are studied in these publications are concerned with the 
tendency exhibited by certain metals to demethylate the 
paraffms or in other words to promote scission of the 
carbon-carbon bonds located at one end of the chain. 
The selective metals for this reaction can depend on the 
type of hydrocarbon which is considered in the test. 
When n-heptane is employed as a test molecule the most 
selective metals for demethylation are palladium, rho 
dium and nickel (cf. J .H. Sinfelt, p. 105). On the other 
hand, metals such as platinum are known for their abil 
ity to effect a statistically oriented scission on all the 
carbon-carbon bonds of a paraffin chain. 
The documentary references cited in the foregoing 

do not make any mention‘ of methods which permit the 
achievement of selective hydrogenolysis of alkanes for 
producing ethane. 
The aim of the present invention is to provide a 

method for selective hydrogenolysis of alkanes to eth 
ane. In particular, when applied to light alkanes, the 
method according to the invention is conducive to the 
following reactions:

The catalysts employed in the method according to 
the present invention comprise‘ either rhodium or irid 
ium or a combination of these twosubstances or alterna 
tively an association of one of these two metals with a 
metal selected from group VIII of the Periodic Table of 
Elements, that is to say the group comprising iron, 
cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, palladium, osmium and plati 
num, these metals being incorporated in an inert support 
in which S04 - ions are not present. 
The inert support is constituted by a refractory oxide 

which can be selected from the inert supports currently 
employed in heterogenous catalysis. Mention can be 
made by way of example of silica, the amorphous or 
crystallized aluminum silicates (zeolites), magnesium 
oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide and so forth. 
An inert refractory oxide support is understood to 

mean a support which does not contain active metallic 
elements and does not react with the feed either by 
hydrogenation, isomerization, cracking, dismutation 
and so forth when placed in the presence of the feed 
under the operating conditions of the method according 
to the invention. Moreover, in order to ensure selectiv 
ity of the method in regard to the production of ethane, 
it is important to ensure that the catalyst employed has 
an S04 — sulphate ion content which is as low as possi 
ble. 
The S04 - sulphate ion content will usually be less 

than 0.5 % by weight and preferably less than 0.1 % by 
weight. 
The metal or metals employed are incorporated with 

the inert support so as to ensure dispersion within this 
latter; the supports employed will therefore have a large 
effective area. 
The effective area of the inert support is within the 

range of 10 to 800 mZ/g and preferably 50 to 500 mZ/g. 
The catalysts in accordance with the invention have 

a total metal content within the range of 0.1% to 10% 
by weight and preferably 0.2 to 1% by weight. Further 
more, in the case in which‘ the catalyst employed is 
formed by the association of two metals, one of which 
is iridium or rhodium and the other is another metal of 
group VIII, preference will be given to the choice of an 
atomic ratio between iridium or rhodium and the other 
metal of group VIII which is greater than than 0.1 and 
more precisely within the range of 0.16 to 8. 
The metal of group VIII which is preferably em 

ployed in association with iridium or rhodium is plati 
num. The preferential catalysts according to the inven 
tion are thus the iridium-platinum or rhodium-platinum 
catalysts. 
The method of selective production of ethane by 

hydrogenolysis of alkanes in contact with the catalysts 
mentioned earlier is carried out under a total pressure 
which varies between 1 and 80 bar, preferably between 
20 and 70 bar, in order to ensure sufficient stability of 
the catalyst. The molar ratio at the inlet of the reactor 
between the hydrogen and the hydrocarbon will be 
maintained between 2 and 20 (preferably between 4 and 
12). The temperature of reaction is closely dependent 
on the activity of the catalyst employed and on the 
pressure imposed by reason of the inhibiting effect of 
hydrogen on the kinetics of hydrogenolysis of alkanes. 
It will be possible to carry out the reaction between _ 
150° C. and 550° C. but more usually between 300° and 
450° C., depending on the type of hydrocarbon sub 
jected to the reaction (the heaviest paraffms correspond 
to the lowest reaction‘ temperatures). Another impor 



4,166,077

tant operating variable is the hourly spatial velocity 
de?ned as the ratio of total flow rate of the reaction 
mixture which is assumed to be gaseous under normal 
conditions to volume of catalyst. The method according 
to the present invention is characterized by a spatial 
velocity within the range of 200 to 10,000 h-1 (the low 
values being characteristic of low-pressure tests). In 
practice, that is to say at pressures at which the catalyst 
is stable, the spatial velocity will be within the range of 
200 to 5000 h— 1. 
A minimum production of at least about 39 weight 

percent ethane is achieved. 
As can readily be understood, all that has just been 

explained in connection with selective hydrogenolysis 
of alkanes is applicable to the conversion of alkenes 
provided that these latter have previously been hydro 
genated. 
A further object of the invention is the production of 

ethylene from alkanes (contained for example in a light 
gasoline) with a very much higher yield than those 
which can be achieved by means of the conventional 
process of direct steam cracking. To this end, there will 
be contemplated in a ?rst step the selective hydrogenol 
ysis of gasoline to produce ethane and, in a second step, 
a reaction of steam cracking of the ethane thus formed 
to produce ethylene. It is of interest to note that the 
hydrogen produced in the second step can be employed 
for satisfying the hydrogen requirements of the ?rst 
step. In the second step of this process, the yield of 
ethylene with respect to ethane can normally be ex 
pected to attain 85% by weight. If this result is then 
applied to those obtained by selective hydrogenolysis to 
ethane of the gasoline mentioned earlier, it is possible to 
attain an ethylene yield of 57% by weight approxi 
mately with respect to the gasoline. This result is clearly 
very superior to the performances which can be ex~ 
pected from a steam cracking operation performed in a 
single step on the same feedstock (25%). 

Further properties and advantages of the invention 
will become more readily apparent from the following 
description of practical examples which are given by 
way of explanation without any implied limitation, ref 
erence being made to the accompanying drawings, 
wherein: 
FIG. 1 shows the weight yields of conversion to 

ethane in respect of different values of relative concen 
tration of the pair Pt - Ir. 

. FIG. 2 shows the half-reaction temperatures in re 
spect of different values of relative concentration of the 
pair Pt - Ir. 
FIG. 3 shows the curves of selectivity - conversion 

yield - reaction temperatures which correspond to dif 
ferent catalysts having a rhodium base. 
The ?rst series of examples relates to the in?uence of 

the sulphate ions of the support on the selectivity of the 
bimetallic catalysts having a rhodium base. 

FIRST SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

' A series of three catalysts containing 0.6% of rho 
dium and 0.4% by weight of platinum are prepared by 
impregnation of alumina. To this end, a certain quantity 
(100 g) of said alumina and a volume of solution con 
taining on the one hand hydrated rhodium chloride 
RhCl3, 31-120 and on the other hand a platinum salt 
H2PtCl6 are brought together. The total volume of 
solution is chosen so as to be equal to the volume of 
retention of the support sample.

The solution is first placed in a beaker, the alumina is 

poured into the beaker in a single operation and rapid 
stirring is carried out until an apparently homogeneous 
mixture is obtained. The impregnated solid is allowed to 
stand for a period of 3 hours. The catalyst is then dired 
at 100° C. for a period of 1 hour followed by calcination 
for a period of 4 hours at 520° C. 
The catalyst is then subjected to testing in a continu 

ous-?ow reaction vessel which operates at atmospheric 
pressure. First of all, the catalyst is reduced in a hydro 
gen atmosphere at 450° C., then tested with a spatial 
velocity of 500 h—1 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio 
equal to 10 mole/mole. The tested hydrocarbon (al 
kane) is pure n-butane. 

Several types of alumina have been employed for 
preparing the catalyst. These are all 'y-aluminas which 
are selected on account of their low cost and availability 
and have closely related physical and chemical charac 
teristics. 

In this example as in the following example, the 
physico-chemical characteristics of the aluminas are as 
follows (all the percentages indicated are percentages 
by weight unless otherwise stated).

C 180 0.02 0.1 0.03 0.76 

In these examples, the aluminas A, B and C therefore 
differ essentially in their S04 - ion content. 
The catalysts prepared respectively from the alumi 

nas A, B and C and all containing 0.4% Pt+0.6% Rh 
will have the notation : 

(0.4% Pt+0.6% Rh) A

(0.4% Pt+0.6% Rh) C 

The expression “ethane selectivity” has been adopted 
to designate the ratio : 

SC2=% cy% C1+% C2+% C3 

where % C,-=molar % of hydrocarbon containing 1' 
carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon ef?uent discharged 
from the reactor. 
By varying the temperature of the reactor, all other 

conditions being equal, the conversion yield (quantity 
of alkane converted) is caused to vary and SCZ is mea 
sured.

This table clearly shows the harmful effct produced 
by the presence of the sulphate ions in the alumina both 
in regard to the activity of the rhodium-base bimetallic 
catalysts and on their selectivity. 
A second series of examples shows the in?uence of 

the sulphate ions contained in the supporton the selec

SECOND SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

A series of three catalysts containing 0.3% platinum 
and 0.3% iridium are prepared by impregnation of alu 
mina. The conditions of preparation of the support are 
the same as in the ?rst series of examples, the only dif 
ference being that the platinum salt employed is 
HzPtCh; and the iridium salt is HZII'C16. The aluminas A, 
B and C are the same as those described in the ?rst 
series of examples. 
The following catalysts have been tested:

The third and fourth series of examples illustrate the 
harmful effect of the sulphate ion content of an alumina 
support on the selectivity of a monometallic catalyst. 

THIRD SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

A series of catalysts containing 0.3% by weight of 
iridium deposited on a high area alumina has been pre 
pared in the laboratory by bringing together a‘certain 
quantity of this alumina (100 g) and a volume of hy 
drated hexachloroiridic acid solution equal to the reten 
tion volume of the support sample. The solution being 
placed in a beaker, the alumina is poured in a single 
operation and rapid stirring is effected until a homoge 
neous mixture is obtained. The impregnated solid is 
allowed to stand for a period of 3 hours; the catalyst is 
then dried at 100° C. for a period of 1 hour and calcined 
for a period of 4 hours at 520° C. The catalytic test is 
then carried out in a continuous-?ow reactor which

contains a small quantity of the catalyst and operates at 
atmospheric pressure. 

After reducing the catalyst in a ?ow of hydrogen at 
450° C., said catalyst is tested at a spatial velocity equal 
to 500 h-1 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon molar ratio 
equal to 10. The hydrocarbon employed is pure n 
butane. 

Several types of alumina have been employed for 
preparing the catalyst. These are all 'y-aluminas which 
are selected on account of their low cost and availabil 
ity; they have similar physico-chemical properties. 

In this example as in the following example, the char 
acteristics of the physico-chemical aluminas are as fol 
lows:

By varying the temperature of the reactor, all other 
conditions being equal, the conversion yield is caused to 
vary and the corresponding selectivity Sc; is measured.

A series of supported catalysts composed of 0.2%

employed earlier (third series of examples) in the case of ‘ 
iridium-base catalysts. Use was made of the same alu

It is apparent from all these results that, in order t ' ‘ ' 

carry out selective hydrogenolysis of n-butane to eth- ‘15 
ane, it is also possible to make use of rhodium catalysts 
and that these latter are better than the iridium-base 
catalysts. . 

So far as the use of rhodium is concerned and in 
contrast to iridium, the results of the present invention 
can be compared with the selectivity obtained in the 
case of nondispersed rhodium on a support in contact 
with n-butane; J .R. Anderson and B6. Baker have in 
fact published the following results in Proc. Roy. Soc. 

20 

These twelve catalysts are subjected to a test consist 
ing of hydrogenolysis of pure n-butane by pure hydro 
gen after preliminary reduction of the metallic phase at 
450° C. for a period of 16 hours in a ?ow of hydrogen 
of 25 l/h (in respect of 3 cm3 of volume of catalyst).

A metal ?lm of rhodium was employed and Sc; was 
calculated from the data given by the authors; these 
results are distinctly inferior to those found in the case 
of rhodium dispersed on an alumina containing less than 
0.5% of sulphate ions. 

FIFTH SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

The object is to de?ne the optimum composition of 
bimetallic compounds having an iridium base. In these 
examples, consideration will be given to the case of the 
platinum-iridium pairs supported by an alumina which 
is free of sulphate ions. 
A series of twelve catalysts was prepared in the labo 

ratory by the conventional method of impregnation of a 
pure high-area alumina (alumina A and A’ of the previ 
ous examples) in the presence of an excess quantity of 
acqueous phase. The method employed is that which 
has already been described in the prior art (cf. French 
Pat. No. 2,080,099). This method consists in incorporat 
ing 100 g of high-purity alumina having an effective 
area in the vicinity of 200 mz/g-l with 100 cm3 of solu 
tion containing the desired quantities of hexachloropla 
tinic acid and hexachloroiridic acid with, in addition, 
0.9 cm3 of a 20% solution of monoethanolamine. Prior 
to impregnation, steps will be taken to treat the support 
with 140 cm3 of water for a period of 30 minutes and, 
after centrifugation, with 80 cm3 of water containing 5.7 
cm3 of hydrochloric acid (having a density of 1.18) for 
a period of 7 hours. The impregnation is more complete 
with gentle agitation of the solid-liquid mixture. The 
contacting time is 5 hours. This is followed by centrifu 
gation, drying for a period of 1 hour at 100° C. and 
activation for a period of 4 hours 520° C. in the presence 
of air. 
The twelve catalysts thus prepared correspond to the 

compositions given below :

surements during one day. The selectivity of catalysts is 
characterized by the production of ethane, consider 
ation being accordingly given to the weight yield of 
ethane from n-butane (95% molar conversion). Further 
more, the activity of the catalysts will be characterized 
by‘the reactor temperature which is necessary in order 
to obtain a conversion of 50% (half-reaction tempera 
ture), the catalyst being more active as the temperature 
is lower. 
The results obtained are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. In 

FIG. 1, the percentage by weight of platinum is plotted 
as abscissae and the percentage vby weight of iridium is 
plotted as ordinates. There is associated with each num 
ber of the catalyst (surrounded by a circle) the number 
representing the weight yield of ethane. The catalysts 
corresponding to an atomic ratio Ir/Pt lower than 0.12 
have been found to be less active, to have low selectiv 
ity and low stability. Furthermore, the catalysts corre 
sponding to an atomic ratio Ir/Pt higher than 8 are 
distinctly less selective than those which have an atomic 
ratio Ir/Pt within the range of 0.16 to 8 (cf. FIG. 1). 
Thus a ?rst preferential domain is located between the 
straight lines L1 and L; of FIG.'1. 
The temperatures of half-reaction are shown in FIG. 

2 with the same coordinatesas in FIG. 1. It can be seen 
thatv the activity of the catalysts increases to a slight 
extent with the content of iridium alone. 
A further criterion of comparison of the catalysts 

employed in the method according to the invention is 
the study of the tendencyv of these latter to produce 
methane by means of parasitic reactions such as: 

In the products of these reactions, methane has the 
disadvantage in that hydrogen cannot readily be recov

This example shows that isobutane has a particular 
behavior which is very probably related to its structure. 
It is in fact possible to obtain ethane from this hydrocar 
bon only under postulated conditions in which the cata 
lyst is also isomerizing (which has not been observed) or 
in which two molecules of methane are formed with or 
without intermediate passing through propane. The 
situation is more favorable in the case of n-pentane, 
better in the case of n-hexane and excellent in the case of 
n-butane. 
The light gasoline which we have tested contains 

high proportions of iso C5 and of iso C6. However, the 
yields obtained show that the isomer contents do not 
reduce the selectivity of the reaction. This difference is 
very marked when n- and iso-butane are compared and 
therefore becomes negligible in respect of C5, C6 and 
also C7, C3 and so forth. 

EIGHTH SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

All the metals of group VIII associated with iridium 
on a conventional inert support containing a low pro 
portion of sulphate ions result in selective catalysts for 
the selective hydrogenolysis of alkanes to ethane. ‘ 
The following examples relate to tests carried out atv 

atmospheric pressure over a period of 24 hours (during 
which the catalyst is stable) at a spatial velocity of 500 
h—1, a hydrogen-feedstock ratio of 6 mole/mole and a 
feedstock consisting of pure n-butane. The catalysts are 
prepared by dry impregnation of a pure high-area alu 
mina A (aluminaA in the examples given earlier) in 
accordance with the conventional method. 

In this case also, the expression “ethane selectivity” 
has been adopted to designate the ratio: 

% Ci = molar percentage of hydrocarbon containing 1' atoms of carbon in 
the carbonaceous ej?uent.

NINTH SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

A series of catalysts containing rhodium to which 
were added the following metals: 

iron 
palladium 
cobalt 
nickel 
platinum 
ruthenium 
iridium 

was prepared by impregnation on a high-area, high 
purity type A alumina of the previous examples. To this 
end, a_ certain quantity of this alumina (100 g) was 
placed in a volume of solution containing on the one 
hand hydrated rhodium chloride RhCl3, 3H2O and on 
the other hand a salt containing the addition metal. The 
total volume of solution is chosen so as to be equal to 
the volume of retention of the support sample. 
The salts corresponding to the metals mentioned 

earlier were as follows: Fe (N03); Pd (NO3)2; PdClz; 
C0 (N03); Ni (NO3)2; PtCl6H2; RuCl3; IrCl6H2. 
The solution is placed in a beaker, the alumina is 

poured in a single operation and stirred briskly until an 
apparently homogeneous mixture is obtained. The im 
pregnated solid is allowed to stand for 3 hours. The 
catalyst is then dried at 100° C. for 1 hour, then calcined 
for 4 hours at 520° C. 
A test is then carried out on the catalyst in a continu 

ous-?ow reactor which operates at atmospheric pres 
sure. First of all, the catalyst is reduced in a hydrogen 
atmosphere at 450° C., then tested at a spatial velocity 
of 500 h-1 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio equal to 
10 mole/mole. The hydrocarbon (alkane) under exami 
nation is pure n-butane. 
The object of the following examples is to show that 

the association of rhodium with other metals of group 
VIII makes it possible to obtain excellent selectivity for 
selective hydrogenolysis to ethane. 
(1) Case of association of Pt-Rh 

In FIG. 3, there is shown as a function of the conver 
sion yield the selectivity of different catalysts which are 
all supported by the same alumina (A) and correspond 
to the following metallic compositions (the percentages 
indicated are percentages by weight): 

Catalyst A: 0.3% Rh+0.3% Pt (curve 4) 

Catalyst B: 0.6. % Rh+0.4% Pt (curve 6) 

Catalyst C: 0.6% Rh (curve 2) 

In FIG. 3, there is shown as a function of the molar 
conversion yield of n-butane the quantity Sc; desig 
nated as “ethane selectivity” and defined by the expres 
sion: 

% C,-=molar percentage of hydrocarbon containing i 
carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon effluent discharged 
from the reactor.

The corresponding temperature of the reaction is‘ 

13 

indicated between brackets next to each experimental‘ 
point plotted in FIG. 3. It is proved by all the results 
shown in this figure that, if pure supported rhodium 
already has appreciable selectivity as stated earlier, this 
latter is considerably improved when platinum is added 
to the rhodium and especially in the case of the catalyst 
which has the composition of 0.4% Pt+0.6% Rh by 
weight which exhibits at 190° C. a molar conversion of 
99.5% and a molar selectivity of 75.7%. 
(2) Case of bimetallic systems other than Pt-Rh 

Bimetallic systems other than Pt-Rh have been found 
which are either more selective or just as selective as 
pure rhodium deposited on a support when the conver 
sion rate is of high value. Thus in the case of a spatial 
velocity equal to 500 h-1 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon 
ratio equal to 10 mole/mole, the following results have 
accordingly been obtained:

TENTH SERIES OF EXAMPLES 

This tenth series consists of a detailed study of the 
Ni-Rh system which is prepared from a different alu 
mina. In this case, the two metals have been incorpo 
rated in a conventional manner with the alumina sup 
port having the following characteristics: effective area 
of 24 m2/ g, alkali-metal ion content 0.08, iron content of 
0.02, silica content 0.02 and sulphate content 0.01. 

All the catalysts thus prepared contained 8.5X10-5 
gram-atom of total metal (Ni and Rh) per gram of cata 
lyst. A series of catalysts having a variable rhodium 
content was thus prepared and tested under reaction 
conditions which were identical with those described 
earlier. 

In this case the selectivity of the catalyst was charac 
terized by the number S which is de?ned by the rela 
tiOn:

The results obtained are indicated below and clearly 
show the synergetic effect achieved by the combination 
of the two metals although the effective area of the 
support has been considerably reduced and is located 
outside the preferential ranges.

CATALYST REGENERATION IN A CATALYTIC 
REFORMING PROCESS 

RELATED APPLICATIONS 

This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 
394,669 filed July 2, 1982 and now abandoned. 

I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
This invention relates to a process for the regenera 

tion of metal promoted platinum-iridium catalysts, par 
ticularly the regeneration of platinum-iridium-selenium 
catalysts with hydrogen. 
II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND 

PRIOR ART 

Catalytic reforming, or hydroforming, is a well estab 
lished industrial process employed by the petroleum 
industry for improving the octane quality of naphthas 
or straight run gasolines. In reforming, a multi-func 
tional catalyst is employed which contains a metal hy 
drogenation-dehydrogenation (hydrogen transfer) com 
ponent, or components, substantially atomically dis 
persed upon the surface of a porous, inorganic oxide 
support, notably alumina. Noble metal catalysts, nota 
bly of the platinum type, are currently employed, re 
forming being defined as the total effect of the molecu 
lar changes, or hydrocarbon reactions, produced by 
dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes and dehydroisomeri 
zation of alkylcyclopentanes to yield aromatics; dehy 
drogenation of paraffins to yield olefins; dehydrocycli 
zation of paraffins and olefins to yield aromatics; isom 
erization of n-paraffins; isomerization of alkylcyclo 
paraffins to yield cyclohexanes; isomerization of substi 
tuted aromatics; and hydrocracking of paraffins which 
produces gas, and inevitably coke, the latter being de 
posited on the catalyst. 

Platinum has been widely commercially used in re 
cent years in the production of reforming catalysts, and 
platinum-on-alumina catalysts have been commercially 
employed in refineries for the last few decades. In the 
last decade, polymetallic metal catalysts have been em 
ployed to provide, at reforming conditions, improved 
catalyst activity, selectivity and stability. Thus, addi 
tional metallic components have been added to plati 
num as promotors to further improve, particularly, the 
activity of selectivity, or both, of the basic platinum 
catalyst, e.g., iridium, rhenium, selenium, tin, and the 
like. Platinum-iridium catalysts, for example, possess 
superior activity for use in reforming operations as 
compared with platinum catalysts. Selenium has also 
been added to the platinum-iridium catalyst, the catalyst 
containing the triumvirate of metals possessing admira 
bly higher selectivity as contrasted with platinum cata 
lysts, or platinum-iridium catalysts, respectively, selec 
tivity being defined as the ability of the catalyst to pro 
duce high yields of Cs+ liquid products with concur 
rent low production of normally gaseous hydrocarbons, 
i.e., methane and other gaseous hydrocarbons, and 
coke. 

In a typical process, a series of reactors constitute the 
heart of the reforming unit. Each reforming reactor is 
generally provided with fixed beds of the catalyst 
which receive upflow or downflow feed, and each is 
provided with a preheater or interstage heater, because 
the reactions which take place are endothermic. A 
naphtha feed, with hydrogen, or recycle gas, is concur 
rently passed through a preheat furnace and reactor,

2 
and then in sequence through subsequent heaters and 
reactors of the series. The product from the last reactor 
is separated into a liquid fraction, i.e., a Cs+ or a 
C5/430 F. fraction, and a vaporous effluent. The latter 
is a gas rich in hydrogen, which usually contains small 
amounts of normally gaseous hydrocarbons, from 
which hydrogen is separated from the Cs+ liquid prod 
uct and recycled to the process to minimize coke pro 
duction. Hydrogen is produced in net yield. 
The activity of the catalyst gradually declines due, at 

least in part, to the building-up of coke. Coke formation 
is believed to result from cracking and polymerization 
reactions; perhaps from the deposition of coke precur 
sors such as anthracene, coronene, ovalene and other 
condensed ring aromatic molecules on the catalyst, 
these polymerizing to form coke. During operation, the 
temperature of the process is gradually raised to com 
pensate for the activity loss caused by coke deposition. 
Eventually, however, economics dictates the necessity 
of reactivating the catalyst. Consequently, in all pro 
cesses of this type the catalyst must necessarily be peri 
odically regenerated by removal of the coke from the 
catalyst. Typically, in the regeneration, the coke is 
burned from the catalyst at controlled conditions. In a 
regeneration of this type, the catalyst is contacted with 
oxygen at flame front temperatures ranging about 800 
F. to about 1050” F., this being generally followed by a 
secondary burn with increased oxygen concentrations 
as coke is depleted from the catalyst. Coke has also been 
removed from catalysts by contact with hydrogen at 
elevated temperature. 
Two major types of reforming are generally commer 

cially practiced in the multi reactor units, both of which 
necessitate periodic reactivation of the catalyst, the 
initial sequence of which requires regeneration, i.e., 
burning the coke from the catalyst. Reactivation of the 
catalyst is then completed in a sequence of steps 
wherein the agglomerated metal hydrogenation-dehy 
drogenation components are atomically redispersed. In 
the semi-regenerative process, a process of the first 
type, the entire unit is operated by gradually and pro 
gressively increasing the temperature to maintain the 
activity of the catalyst caused by the coke deposition, 
until finally the entire unit is shut down for regenera 
tion, and reactivation, of the catalyst. In the second, or 
cyclic type of process, the reactors are individually. 
isolated, or in effect swung out of line by various mani 
folding arrangements, motor operated valving and the 
like. The catalyst is regenerated to remove the coke 
deposits, and the reactivated while the other reactors of 
the series remain on stream. A "swing reactor' tempo 
rarily replaces a reactor which is removed from the 
series for regeneration and reactivation of the catalyst, 
until it is put back in series. 
The ability to regenerate the coked catalyst during 

operation, as in the operation of cyclic units, means of 
course, that relatively short cycle lengths are possible. 
Thus, in the operation of a cyclic unit the reforming 
operation is conducted at higher severities, i.e., lower 
pressures, lower hydrogen recycle rates, and higher 
temperatures than in a semi-regenerative operation. In 
cyclic operations, coke deposits on the catalyst at a 
much higher rate and hence, typically, the catalyst of a 
reactor must be regenerated every 60 to 80 hours. In 
contrast, in the operation of a semi regenerative unit the 
unit usually remains on stream for several months, typi 
cally about six months, or longer. Higher Cst liquid 



4,440,667

and hydrogen yields are obtained in cyclic operations as 
contrasted with semi-regenerative operations. 

In fluidized bed operations, and in fluidized magneti 
cally stabilized bed operation where the catalyst is made 
magnetic by the incorporation of a small amount of 
magnetic material and a magnetic field applied, excel 
lect contacting is achieved between the feed and cata 
lyst. Regeneration is accomplished by transport of the 
fluidized bed from the reaction zone or vessel into a 
regeneration zone, or vessel. If desired, the bed can be 
moved into the regeneration zone, or zones, by appro 
priate manipulation of the magnetic fields. 

Platinum-iridium-selenium catalysts offer significant 
Cs -- liquid yield and activity credits relative to the 
best of present-day commercially used catalysts, and 
these catalysts offer these advantages at fluidized bed, 
magnetically stabilized, semi-regenerative and cyclic 
severities. Like other known iridium-containing cata 
lysts, however, these catalysts are highly sensitive to 
iridium metal agglomeration in the presence of oxygen 
at high temperatures. Specially developed techniques 
must therefore be practiced in the regeneration of such 
catalysts. 

III. THE INVENTION 

It is, in any regard, a primary objective of the present 
invention to provide a novel process for the regenera 
tion of metal promoted platinum-iridium catalysts, or 
platinum-iridium catalysts to which one or more addi 
tional metal components have been added. 
A further objective is to provide a novel reforming 

process for effecting with these catalysts, at specified 
operating conditions, the production of high octane 
gasolines at superior Cs -- liquid yields, with high 
catalyst activity and activity maintenance. 
These objects and others are achieved in accordance 

with this invention, embodying a catalyst regeneration 
process wherein a platinum-iridium catalyst promoted 
with one or more of copper, sulfurous acid or sulfuric 
acid, or selenium component, preferably a platinum 
iridium-selenium catalyst, coked after contact with nap 
tha at reforming conditions, is regenerated by contact 
with hydrogen or hydrogen containing gas thereby 
restoring its ability to produce high yields of high oc 
tane product. 
These catalysts especially the platinum-iridium 

selenium catalysts, possess a novel advantage in that 
high activity and yield can be obtained during its use in 
the reforming portion of the total operating cycle. Also, 
these catalysts can be readily regenerated with hydro 
gen, this permitting their use at severe conditions; con 
ditions heretofore impractical in commercial practice. 
In a fluidized bed or magnetically stabilized fluidized 
bed, short reaction times on the order of 0.25 to 4.0 
hours can be utilized at temperatures of 950 F. to 1000 
F. and pressures of 50 to 300 psig. In this type of pro 
cess, it is even practical to efficiently use feedstocks 
containing sulfur in considerably higher concentrations 
than heretofore considered practical, viz., in the order 
of 10 parts per million parts by weight (ppm) and 
greater; suitably in the order of from about 10 ppm to 
about 150 ppm sulfur by weight. Once deactivated, the 
fluidized catalyst in a preferred mode of operation is 
rapidly transferred to a regeneration vessel wherein the 
carbonaceous deposit is removed by contact with hy 
drogen and the catalyst recycled to the reactor. 

In cyclic operations, the naphtha is reformed at cyclic 
severities for a period of at least about 60 hours, prefera 
bly for a period ranging from about 60 hours to about

200 hours, and more preferably from about 60 hours to 
about 100 hours. In semi-regenerative operations, the 
catalyst can be contacted with naphtha and the naphtha 
reformed at semi-regenerative severities for a period of 
at least about 600 hours, preferably for a period ranging 
from about 600 hours to about 4000 hours, more prefer 
ably from about 600 hours to about 1000 hours. The 
catalyst is then regenerated in situ or ex situ by contact 
with the hydrogen. Cyclic severities are defined as 
follows, to wit: 

Operating Variables Preferred More Preferred 

Pressure, psig 100-300 150-200 
Average Reactor Temperature 930-1000 950-1000

Semi-regenerative severities are defined as follows, to

Temperature, E.I.T. 
Recycle Gas Rate, SCF/B 1000-10,000 2000-6000 
Feed Rate WAWAHr. -5 1-3 

Fluidized bed and magnetically stabilized fluidized bed 
severities are essentially the same as those described as 
cyclic severities except that the pressure preferably 
ranges from about 50 to about 150 psig, more preferably 
from about 50 to about 100 psig. The regeneration of the 
catalysts with hydrogen virtually completely restores 
the activity, selectivity, and selectivity maintenance of 
the catalysts for use in fluidized bed, cyclic or semi 
regenerative reforming operations to essentially that of 
fresh catalysts. 
The hydrogen regeneration step is normally carried 

out at unit pressure although pressure increases during 
the regeneration of from about 50 to about 200 psig 
above operating pressure may be useful. The regenera 
tion temperature applied to the catalyst of a reactor is 
equal to or normally greater than the overall Equivalent 
Isothermal Temperature (E.I.T.) applied to the reactor 
during the reforming process. Suitably the temperature 
ranges from about 950 F. to about 1100 F., more pref. 
erably from about 950 F. to about 1050 F. The regen 
eration period is a function of catalyst coke level which 
in turn is sensitive to feed composition and severity. 
Thus, the frequency and duration of the hydrogen re 
generation is related to on oil activity as a function of 
feed endpoint, operating temperature, and hydrogen 
and oil partial pressures as determined by unit pressure, 
recycle gas purity, and recycle rate. In general, the 
frequency of hydrogen regeneration will be determined 
by the rate of deactivation and the duration of regenera 
tion by the amount of coke needed to be removed to 
restore an acceptable level of activity. Suitably, the 
regeneration period can range from about 0.5 hour to 
about 48 hours, a period of from about 3 hours to about 
24 hours being preferred. In general, higher regenera 
tion temperatures permit briefer regeneration periods. 
The following examples and comparative demonstra 

tions are exemplary of the present invention.

The mid-cycle data given in Table III (50 hr. on oil) 
show nearly equivalent performance for fresh and H2 
regenerated Pt-Ir-Se. The aromatic selectivity data 
illustrate that the reforming chemistry of the two cata 
lysts was not altered by the regeneration. The 80 hr. 
activities and yields show that the midcycle relation 
ships persist with additional time on oil. 

EXAMPLE 3 

Additional runs made with the Pt-Ir-Se catalyst show 
that at cyclic conditions the H2 regenerated Pt-Ir-Se 
catalyst is superior to fresh commercially used plati 
num-iridium and platinum-rhenium catalysts, both ref. 
erence catalysts being operated at preferred cyclic con 
ditions. Reference is made to Table IV. While no activ 
ity credit relative to the platinum-iridium catalyst is 
seen, a substantial Pt-Ir-Se yield credit arises from the 
suppression of cracking by Se.

In another run the Pt-Ir-Se catalyst was used to re 
form the paraffinic naphtha at semi-regen conditions. 
After 600-800 hours on oil the catalyst was H2 regener 
ated at 1000' F. for 18 hours. Table V presents illustra

The 750 hour data show the deactivated state of the 2 
catalyst prior to regeneration. The fresh and H2 regen 
erated catalyst are compared at 150 hours on oil relative 
to start-of-run and post-regeneration. The ability of H2 
regeneration to restore fresh activity is evident. The 
aromatic selectivities show the identical reforming 3 
chemistry of fresh and regenerated catalyst and the 
difference with the deactivated catalyst where coking 
has produced a shift in favor of heavy aromatics. 

EXAMPLE 5 

Table VI further shows the effect of three successive 
H2 regenerations at intervals of 150 hours on Pt-Ir-Se 
catalyst runs at semi-regen conditions for 600 hours. 
While the frequency of regeneration is high, the data 
support directionally the feasibility for multiple H2 
regenerations.

Successful production of 1800mm pipes in SDR26 – pipes showed a smooth surface inside 


[image: image4.jpg][image: image5.jpg]
Production of 1800 mm pipe in SDR 11 and SDR 17 reached a limit in manufacturing. Due to an insufficient length of the relaxing zone (die land) in the pipe head and no control over the temperature memory effect dominates over sagging. Problem is not related to a specific material. 
Approvals
Large pipe are not subjected to any approvals. Pipelife makes with its customers special specification agreements where easy accessible properties are laid down like MFR, OIT, etc. Customer has to sign specification agreement before start of pipe extrusion.
Small pipes in utility applications are subjected to INSTA and DTC approvals. Both are related to pipe tests where the initiate has to be taken by Pipelife. Mr. Hestas estimated the accumulated costs for INSTA and DTC by 17000 NOK (2200 Euro). We have to negotiate with Pipelife the time frame and the costs (action JB).

Aim:
The reason for this visit was a trial-run with our AX 7527 ( A 5061 R with lower MFR) to check the sagging of this grade on a customer-line. We produced a pipe 560 SDR 13,6 ( 41,2 mm wall-thickness).

Summary / Conclusions:
After problems regarding roughness of the pipes caused by die-deposits the production of the pipes made no problems. The sagging-behaviour was judged as good by Egeplast. They ranked it as as good as Basell GM 5010 T3.

Actions:
Evaluation of the trial-run






 resp. GL
Peparation of a proposition for the VT




 resp. AH
Details:
To improve the sagging-behaviour of our A 5061 R we had run a trial-run in our production. This material AX 7527 had a lowered MFR coming from 0.5 g/10min to 0,35 g/10min. The predictions from our laboratory tests showed similar results to the Borealis 3470 LS (low sagging) grade. We were looking to run a pipe with a higher wall-thickness to get an evaluation from an existing production-line.


Due to the fact that this material had an AX-number and were no A 5061 R within spec it took time to get a customer to produce pipes which could be used for a special project.

Now we had the opportunity to run this material for a sewage-pipe-project at Egeplast. We produced 560 SDR 13,6 pipes (wall-thickness of 41,2 mm) were we have a significant sagging with our standard A 5061 R.

At the beginning of the production the material showed massive die-deposits causing stripes and roughness on the outer pipe-surface. After decreasing the temperature from 200°C to 180°C the die-deposits decreased and the surface of the pipe improved leading to a good surface.

The sagging of the material was judged by the production-people of Egeplast as good and comparable with Basell Hostalen GM 5010 T3, which has a good sagging behaviour. The production was running without any problems after they decreased the temperature of the Extruder and the head. The mass-temperature was nearly 200°C but the pressure (190 bar) as well as the trosional moment were for an output of 700 kg/h o.k..

The results at Egeplast proof our predictions from the lab-trial and show that with a lowered MFR the sagging-behaviour improves.

I persuaded Mr. Wittstock to run Hostalen GM 5010 T3 after our material for a short time so we get something to compare. He will send us the sagging-reports as well as a slice of the pipe for observation.

Beside our trial I saw on one line a 900 SDR 17 pipe running with Hostalen GM 5010 T3. The pipe looked good and had little sagging. The die deposit of this material was much lower than the one with our material but also on this line they had very low temperatures (170°C).

Generally Egeplast is very open to run trials and exchange information so we see Egeplast from the TM point of view as a very important customer.

Review

Sulfated zirconia and its modified versions as promising
catalysts for industrial processes

Ganapati D. Yadav, Jayesh J. Nair
Chemical Engineering Division, University Department of Chemical Technology, University of Mumbai, Matunga, Mumbai 400 019, India

Received 27 August 1998; received in revised form 1 December 1998; accepted for publication 6 July 1999

Abstract

Zirconium oxide, or zirconia, when modified with anions such as sulfate ions forms a highly acidic or superacidic
catalyst depending on the treatment conditions. This catalyst is found to be well suited for catalyzing reactions of industrial
importance, e.g. hydrocarbon isomerization, methanol conversion to hydrocarbons, alkylation, acylation, esterification,
etherification, condensation, nitration, cyclization, hydration–dehydration, carbonylation, oligomerization, Fischer–Tropsch
reaction, cracking and hydrocracking reactions, methane oxidative coupling, thioacetalization, adamantylation, manufacture
of hydrogen peroxide, etc. The surface properties of these catalysts can be further modified in conjunction with noble or
transition metals as promoters as well as with carbon molecular sieves. This review highlights the chemistry and engineering
aspects of sulfated zirconia catalyst and its modified forms. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

3. Nature of active sites

The various techniques used for the character-
ization of these catalysts to throw light on the
origin and nature of active sites activity, which
have been the subject of intense debate, are high-
lighted in Table 5. Technological advances to date
still seem to be inadequate for the complete charac-
terization of the complex nature of these solid
superacidic anion treated transition metal oxides.
As a result, the exact structure of the active sites,
as well as their nature ( Lewis or Bronsted type),
is a subject of debate. Attempts have, however,
been made to unearth these features of the cata-

the formation of a Bronsted-type site. Theby the IR studies. This model has also been
accepted by Davies et al. [ 31 ]. Clearfield et al. model [ 32 ] thus describes the one-

sion for the structure of the active sites describe This type of Bronsted acidity generation has

also been proposed by Kustov et al. [ 33 ], whothe formation of Lewis-type sites due to the highly
covalent character of the adsorbed sulfates and have postulated that the sulfate treatment of

hydrous zirconia results in the elimination of thethe formation of Bronsted sites as a result of the
interaction of water molecules with these sulfates.
In fact, Morterra et al. [ 17] have, for low sulfate
loadings, claimed the presence of Lewis sites to be
predominant, depending on the degree of dehydra-
tion. Their study reveals the presence of a very
low number, though never null, of Bronsted sites
at high dehydration of the catalyst. Nevertheless,
it seems that the formation of these Bronsted sites
is due to the residual amounts of water.

Zirconia can be modified with other mineral

showed that the addition of sulfate, borate and

The XRD results ( Fig. 13 and Table 11 ) show that

benzene produces cumene, an intermediate in the

The results of the reaction of DIPB with other

was found that S-ZrO

would deactivate because

of the heavy compounds in the starting reaction

content of around 3%. According to their observa-
tions it appears that the optimum catalyst should
contain the maximum amount of sulfate near the
surface, but not necessarily on the surface, and it
should crystallize in the tetragonal form. The study
has also indicated that, for the same calcination
temperature, activity is a function of the sulfate
present on the surface, but an examination of the
XPS data indicates that the relationship is not a
simple one, because the activity still increases after
some sulfate has already migrated into the bulk.
It appears likely that some of the sulfate groups
present in the underlying layer might also contrib-
ute to the initiation of the carbocationic reaction
by one-electron oxidation, characteristic to bifunc-
tional types of catalyst. Considering that incorpo-
ration of promoters with redox properties into
S-ZrO

2
greatly increases the catalytic activity with-

out changing the acidity measured by the standard
techniques, it is most likely that oxidizing ability
is the activity-controlling property of this and
similar catalysts. Once the reactive carbocation
precursors have been generated by oxidation, the
acid-catalyzed reactions proceed smoothly. At the
same time, considering that the special oxidizing
character of these materials is generated by the
interaction of sulfate groups with the metal oxide,
full coverage of the surface by sulfate, that is
conversion of the surface to zirconium sulfate,
should destroy the activity. The activity is also
tied to the crystal structure of the zirconia support,
but the latter is, in turn, tied to the quantity of
sulfur present as sulfate on the surface. Hence,
Farcasiu et al. [ 111 ] have suggested that a zirconia
support crystallized in the tetragonal form seems
to be essential for high catalytic activity.

5.7. Nitration

Industrial aromatic nitrations are carried out in
a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid predomi-
nantly giving ortho- and para-substituted products
for substituted benzene, etc. However, this process
has a major problem of the spent acid disposal.
The formation of water during the reaction causes
the dilution of the nitrating mixture, thus reducing
the rate of nitration as the reaction proceeds. At
about 68% w/w H

2
SO

, the nitration becomes

extremely slow. Moreover, it is desirable to
increase the para-selectivity, as the economic point
of view warrants it.

Recent advances in superacid catalysts have
brought considerable research importance to this
reaction. Attempts are being made to reduce the
spent acid generated during this reaction and
